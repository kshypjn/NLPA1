"PAK vs NZ Head-to-Head Record in ODIs, Champions Trophy 2025: Pakistan vs New Zealand stats; most runs and wickets",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/pak-vs-nz-head-to-head-record-odi-stats-champions-trophy-2025-new-zealand-pakistan-most-runs-wickets/article69235914.ece,"Less than a week after squaring up against each other in a tri-series, Pakistan and New Zealand will kick off the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 on Wednesday at the National Bank Stadium in Karachi. Though the Kiwis trounced the host twice within a week, it will be the high-stakes clash on Wednesday they would want to win to get their Champions Trophy campaign to a winning start. For Pakistan, life under new captain Mohammad Rizwan has begun with ODI series wins in Australia and South Africa. Rizwan would want the side to carry that momentum and begin its title defence in style."
"The ODI format, cricket’s middle child, gets new lease of life in Champions Trophy 2025",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/champions-trophy-2025-return-eight-year-gap-odis-50-over-format-future-icc/article69235534.ece,"In psychology, the middle-child syndrome theorys inference is that the second-born in a familystuck between the older and younger siblingsfeels neglected or starved of parental love and attention. In recent times, the One-Day International game has become crickets middle child caught between the classical Tests and the fast-paced T20Is. It has been denied love and proper care from the players and administrators except once every four years, at the 50-over World Cup. After the inaugural World Cup in 1975, ODIs helped grow the sport over the next three decades, raking in the moolah and helping cricket join the big league in terms of commercial value despite its relatively small footprint and reach.  During the final decade of the 20th century, the format breathed fresh air into the sport thanks to a confluence of events led by the sub-continental teams. Some factors included Indias booming economy, Pakistan (1992) and Sri Lanka (1996) becoming world champions, and Bangladesh qualifying for its first World Cup in 1999. To capitalise on the success, the International Cricket Council started another multi-nation tournament, the ICC KnockOut, or the mini World Cup, in 1998 (Dhaka, Bangladesh) to fill its coffers and spread the game. After the second edition (Kenya 2000), it was renamed the ICC Champions Trophy in 2002. The event was held every two years until 2006 and became a quadrennial event from 2009 to 2017 before being discontinued. Following the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, it became evident that T20 would be the future of cricket. The IPL, which started in 2008, further shifted the audience to the three-hour version of the game, leading to the mushrooming of similar leagues across the cricket-playing world. At a time when the one-day format was fighting for relevance, the Champions Trophy suffered an identity crisis. Eight years ago, the apex body pulled the plug because it felt there wasnt a need for two ICC events in one format. However, in 2021, the governing body reversed course and revived the tournament. The ninth edition of this tournament will begin in Karachi on Wednesday, and there is hope that it can help ODIs get back on its feet. The bilateral ODI series, once the cash cow for cricket boards, has become meaningless sans context. But over the last few months, teams have scrambled to play some ODI games before this event in front of packed stadiums. Recently, England skipper Jos Buttler said for ODIs to thrive, the presence of top players will hold the key. A world event once every two years, alternating between the Champions Trophy and World Cup, could keep the big stars invested. Over the next three weeks, a tournament that once symbolised the sports health could hold the key to the 50-over games future and offer a pathway for its survival."

Champions Trophy 2025 Preview: ODI’s best eight vie for top honour as ICC competition returns to Pakistan after 29 years,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/champions-trophy-2025-preview-groups-pakistan-hosting-right-icc-tournament-1996-world-cup/article69234588.ece,"When the last ICC Champions Trophy game was played at The Oval in 2017, the organisers had the dream matchup: archrivals India and Pakistan squaring off for the crown, with the latter emerging triumphant. Despite the success of that event, it was axed from the calendar and was replaced by the T20 World Cup in 2021. Eight years later, the tournament is back, with Pakistan set to host its first ICC competition since the 1996 World Cup. On Wednesday, when the home team takes on New Zealand in Karachi, it will mark a huge moment for the reigning champion and the culmination of more than half-a-decade of work to normalise international cricketing activity in the country. India, though, will not be visiting its neighbour and will play all its matches here at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. While the focus has been on the preparations and readiness of Pakistans stadiums so far, now that the day of reckoning is here, the attention shifts to the on-field action. The idea of having only the top-eight teams was to guarantee high-quality cricket where every game mattered. Over the next three weeks the fans will hope this spirit of the tournament reflects on the pitch. Though it is tough to ascertain a clear favourite, considering sides dont play as many ODI games as before, there is a case to be made that India holds a slight edge, even if it has played only nine ODI games since the 2023 World Cup final - the fewest among the participating nations. Rohit Sharmas men blanked England 3-0 recently and have a settled combination even in the absence of pace spearhead Jaspirt Bumrah. Drawn alongside Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand in Group A, the Men in Blue should fancy themselves to reach the last four. With the home support behind it, Pakistan will want to defend its crown, but the twin defeats to New Zealand in the recent tri-series, including the final, will be weighing heavily, and Mohammad Rizwans men cant afford another reverse against the Kiwis in the opener. Having played frequently in Pakistan in recent years, the Black Caps will bank on that experience to go deep into the event. In contrast, Group B is where things could get interesting and has a potential for surprise. Australia, the ODI champion, doesnt appear strong on paper. Its bowling attack wears a thin look after losing its pace unit. Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood were ruled out due to injuries, while Mitchell Starc skipped for personal reasons. The 0-2 loss to Sri Lanka was not ideal preparation either. Meanwhile, South Africa comes in battered and bruised, having lost its last six ODIs, and Englands one-dimensional approach has limitations, as it found against India. Only Afghanistan, making its Champions Trophy debut, could feel confident of having a strong chance of progressing from this group. Its potent spin attack, comprising Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmad, and Mohammed Nabi, could be a handful for teams that dont play spin well. However, beyond the cricketing action, the successful conduct of the tournament could herald a new era for Pakistan."
Skipper Rizwan urges Pakistan to enjoy Champions Trophy 2025,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/mohammad-rizwan-pakistan-vs-new-zealand-champions-trophy-2025-press-conference/article69233855.ece,"Pakistan skipper Mohammad Rizwan said on Tuesday the Champions Trophy would be a historic occasion for the country, a day before the host kicks the tournament off against New Zealand. The Champions Trophy is the first major cricket event hosted by Pakistan in nearly three decades and is regarded as second only to the World Cup in the One-Day Internationals. A global event has come to Pakistan after 29 years so I think the whole nation should enjoy this historic occasion, Rizwan told a news conference on the eve of the tournament, which runs until March 9. Pakistan had been due to host the tournament in 2008 but was thrown into cricketing isolation by a security crisis as violence spilled over from the long-running war in neighbouring Afghanistan. Gunmen then attacked a bus carrying Sri Lankas team in Lahore the following year, wounding several players and killing eight policemen and civilians. However, major teams have toured Pakistan in the past five years as security improved, opening the way for the cricket-mad nation to stage the tournament. Pakistan has suffered enough and for a long time, but we have also won during this phase like the 2017 Champions Trophy and the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup, Rizwan said. Still, the build-up has not been without problems after neighbour and arch-rival India refused to play in Pakistan over long-standing political tensions. India will instead play its matches in Dubai. Pakistans opponent in the tournament opener in Karachi beat it twice this month during a tri-series event that included South Africa. There shouldnt be any doubts on our performance, Rizwan said. We may not have played on our abilities but we all want to win the event for the country and people. Rizwan hoped to have pace bowler Haris Rauf on the pitch after he suffered chest muscle strain in the match against New Zealand in Lahore last week. Haris bowled 80 per cent yesterday and today he is bowling at his full rhythm and told us that he is not feeling any discomfort, so I hope he is fully fit, Rizwan said."
"Champions Trophy 2025: India will feel Bumrah’s absence very strongly, says Dhawan",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/champions-trophy-2025-india-chances-jasprit-bumrah-injury-shikhar-dhawan-icc-column/article69233465.ece,"India will feel Jasprit Bumrahs absence very strongly in the Champions Trophy but it still has a great chance to win the tournament considering its recent form and a host of match-winners at its disposal, reckoned former opener Shikhar Dhawan. While the event starts in Pakistan on Wednesday, India start its campaign a day later with a match against neighbour Bangladesh at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Pace spearhead Bumrah was ruled out of the tournament due to a lower back injury, having taken the maximum load during Indias five-match Test series against Australia. My concern is they are going to miss Jasprit Bumrah, there is no doubt he will be a big absence and I think they will feel it very strongly, Dhawan wrote in an ICC column published on Tuesday. For me, he is the best bowler in the world, and his accuracy is hard to replicate. He is also a very calm character and that is crucial in a huge ICC event like this. Dhawan is, however, backing Shubman Gill and Harshit Rana to sizzle in the tournament. At the same time, Harshit has come into the side and I think that is really exciting - keep an eye on him, I think he could have a breakout tournament. I like his attitude, he is a go-getter and he is not afraid of anything. He accepts challenges and we have seen in the England series that he is in form. I am sure he will look to seize this opportunity and, if he does, he could provide a real X-factor for India. Going by recent form and team strength, Dhawan found it hard to look beyond India when the discussion turned to title contenders. There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic for India. They have a very balanced side, especially with the bat  there is a nice blend of experience and youth. Shubman Gill, in particular, is so consistent and he has a big role to play. I think he will have a great tournament. Rohit Sharma has found form, Virat Kohli is there; they are a top side and will take some stopping. Dhawan is also not ruling out teams such as South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and host Pakistan, to which India lost in the title clash in the last edition in the UK. I really like South Africa in this tournament as well. They have played consistent cricket and have everything you need to win such a huge tournament  experience, strength-in-depth and X-factor players like Kagiso Rabada. I also like Pakistan, they will be hard to beat in home conditions, and also New Zealand  who are just always there or there abouts. Australia have struggled in their series with Sri Lanka but they have some great batters; Travis Head is in great form, and Im really excited to see Steve Smith. Dhawan is one of the most successful batters in the tournaments history having scored 701 runs in 10 innings at an average of 77.88. He hit three centuries in the tournament, with his best being 125 against Sri Lanka in 2017. The ICC Champions Trophy means a great deal to me. We won in 2013 and then reached the final in 2017, and both times I finished as leading run-scorer, he added."
Champions Trophy 2025: Records that could be broken this year,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/icc-champions-trophy-2025-virat-kohli-rohit-sharma-most-runs-records-stats-history/article69175040.ece,"The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy will commence on February 19, with Pakistan facing New Zealand in Karachi. The tournament will feature eight teams, divided into two groups of four. A total of 12 group-stage matches will be played, followed by the semifinals and the final. Here are some of the tournament records that could be broken in this edition: Indias batting mainstays, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, will be aiming for the top spot in the Champions Trophys all-time run-scorers list. Kohli currently sits 11th in the standings with 529 runs, while Rohit is in 14th position with 481 runs. Chris Gayle tops the list with 791 runs. Kohli and Rohit are also well placed to break the record for the most 50+ scores in the Champions Trophy, currently held by their compatriots Shikhar Dhawan, Sourav Ganguly, and Rahul Dravid (six each). Kohli and Rohit currently have five 50+ scores in the tournament, accumulated from 13 and 10 matches, respectively. With India guaranteed at least three games in this edition, it is highly likely that one or both of them will equal or surpass the record. No batter has ever scored more than 150 in a Champions Trophy innings. The batting-friendly pitches in Pakistan could provide the ideal conditions for someone to break that barrier. The record for the highest individual score currently belongs to New Zealands Nathan Astle, who struck an unbeaten 145 against USA in 2004. Similarly, the Champions Trophy is yet to witness a 350+ total. With teams adopting a far more aggressive approach in the ODI format, it is highly likely that this edition could see that milestone being reached. The current highest team total in the competition is New Zealands 347/4, scored against USA in 2004. India could become the first team to record 20 wins in the tournament if it secures two victories in this edition. India currently has 18 wins in the Champions Trophy, four more than the next best teams, England and Sri Lanka."
Champions Trophy 2025: Lockie Ferguson ruled out; New Zealand names Jamieson as replacement,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/new-zealand-champions-trophy-2025-lockie-ferguson-injury-news-kyle-jamieson-replacement-squad-schedule/article69232930.ece,"New Zealand pacer Lockie Ferguson was ruled out of the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025 due to a foot injury, announced the team on Tuesday. Ferguson suffered the injury during an informal warm-up match against Afghanistan in Karachi on Sunday and an initial medical assessment indicated he would not be fit enough to take part in the entire tournament. Were really disappointed for Lockie. Lockie is a key part of the bowling group and brings a lot of major tournament experience and we know how much he was looking forward to representing New Zealand at another major event. We wish him well for his recovery and hope he is back firing soon, said Black Caps head coach Gary Stead. The Kiwis also shared that Kyle Jamieson will replace Ferguson in the squad and will soon depart for Pakistan. Jamieson is coming on the back of a 10-month stint on the sideline rehabilitating a stress fracture in his back. He returned to domestic cricket for the Canterbury Kings in the Super Smash in December.  Kyle brings plenty of pace and extra bounce which will suit the conditions here in Pakistan. Hes shown since returning in the Super Smash how effective he can be in the shorter forms of the game, and hes bowled with real pace and energy which is what youre looking for from a pace bowler, especially at a pinnacle event, said Stead. New Zealand begins its Champions Trophy campaign on Wednesday, against Pakistan in Karachi."
"Champions Trophy 2025: Australia full squad, SWOT analysis, and key player to watch",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/australia-team-preview-swot-analysis-champions-trophy-2025-squad-team-players-list/article69201693.ece,"Few teams boast a legacy in global tournaments as formidable as Australias. Heading into the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, the reigning ODI World Cup holder arrives with a squad facing significant challenges. The absence of several key players due to injuries and retirement has forced a reshuffle, leaving Australia with a vastly different line-up from the one that lifted the World Cup trophy in 2023. Australias pace attack has long been its greatest strength, spearheaded by Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc. Between them, they have won two ODI World Cups, a T20 World Cup, and a World Test Championship, and have retained the Ashes. However, the troikas absence places additional pressure on Australias back-up pacers to step up in high-pressure situations. The task becomes even more daunting since Australia will play all its group-stage matches on the flat pitches of Rawalpindi and Lahore. Australias lack of credible spin-bowling options adds another layer of complexity. Legspinner Tanveer Sangha, who was already in Sri Lanka with the Test squad as a development player, joins Adam Zampa as a second frontline spinner. In conditions where spin could play a pivotal role, will the Aussies back one of their young spinners or rely on part-time options such as Glenn Maxwell to supplement Adam Zampa? Either way, the lack of a seasoned second spinner is a glaring issue. A broader problem facing several teams, including Australia, is the lack of ODI cricket leading into this tournament. Since lifting the World Cup trophy in India in November 2023, Australia has played only 14 ODIs, including a two-match ODI series in Sri Lanka, where Sean Abbott and Cooper Connolly, along with domestic stars Jake Fraser-McGurk, Ben Dwarshuis, Spencer Johnson, and Sangha, were added to the squad. Meanwhile, Steven Smith will captain the side in Cummins absence. This overhaul is perhaps the most significant talking point. Australia has also lost all-rounder Mitch Marsh, who was ruled out in late January due to a back injury. Adding to the upheaval, Marcus Stoinis retired from the format in early February, removing a seasoned all-round option from the mix. The batting order will also look different. David Warner has retired, while Cameron Green is unavailable following a back surgery. These absences mean Australia will need to find new solutions at the top of the order and in the middle overs, areas that were previously anchored by experienced campaigners. Player to watch out for The left-handed opener has been a key figure for Australia at the top of the order over the past 24 months. He has consistently looked to take the attack to the bowlers, defying conditions with his aggressive approach from the outset. His return to fitness during the 2023 World Cup proved pivotal, revitalising Australias campaign and culminating in his match-winning 137 against India in the final. While Head has, at times, appeared vulnerable to the short ball, his ability to counterattack remains a defining trait. With Australia placed in Group B alongside Afghanistan, England, and South Africa  all boasting pace attacks capable of exploiting this weakness  his battles against high-quality fast bowling promise to be enthralling. Adding to the intrigue is Australias round-robin fixture in Rawalpindi, a venue that, not long ago, produced a record-breaking 1,768 runs in a single Test match between England and Pakistan. Given the potential for a high-scoring encounter, Head will relish the opportunity to capitalise on favourable batting conditions. Full squad: Australia: Steve Smith (c), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa. Travelling reserve: Cooper Connolly."
Top five players who have never won the ICC Champions Trophy,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/legendary-players-who-never-won-champions-trophy-icc-ct-2025-news/article69188398.ece,"After a gap of eight years, the ICC Champions Trophy is set to return in a hybrid format, with Pakistan and the UAE hosting games between February 19 and March 9, 2025. There have been eight editions of the Champions Trophy held so far, with Australia and India leading the pack with two titles apiece. Here is a list of players who have missed out on winning the ICC Champions Trophy title: AB de Villiers  One of the best ODI batters of his generation with close to 10,000 runs in the format, de Villiers was part of a golden South African generation that always fell short of winning an ICC tournament. Kane Williamson  Until its success in the inaugural World Test Championship, the ICC Knockout Trophy in 2000 was New Zealands only ICC honour. The current generation of Kiwi cricketers, including former skipper Kane Williamson, continue to wait for a limited-overs title. Eoin Morgan  England broke its 50-over World Cup jinx with an inspirational yet slightly controversial victory against New Zealand in 2019 under skipper Morgan. The skipper, who is credited with turning around the countrys fortunes with some attacking cricket, unfortunately missed out on tasting success in the Champions Trophy. Shahid Afridi  Pakistans third-highest wicket-taker in ODI cricket, Afridi had a storied career in the limited-overs format, which included some mighty hits, quickfire centuries, and a few retirement announcements. The all-rounder, who led Pakistan from the front during its 2009 T20 World Cup win, however, ended his career without a Champions Trophy title. Steve Smith  From a leg-spinner to a consistent middle-order batter, Steve Smith has been a vital cog in the Australian side that won two World Cups in a decade. With over 5,600 runs and 12 centuries to his name, the 35-year-old will look to cap his 50-over career with another ICC title in the bag."
Top 5 run-scorers in Champions Trophy: The greatest batters in tournament history,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/icc-champions-trophy-top-run-scorers-record-stats-chris-gayle-shikhar-dhawan/article69179657.ece,"The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is set to begin from February 19 in Pakistan and Dubai, UAE. The two-week long event has seen several consistent performers through the years. Here are the top run-scorers in the ICC Champions Trophy history: 1) Chris Gayle (West Indies) - The destructive opening batter is the highest run-scorer in the Champions Trophy, with 791 runs in 17 innings at an average of 52.73. Gayle has scored three centuries in the tournament and has the highest score of 133 not out, which he achieved against Australia in 2006. 2) Mahela Jayawardene (Sri Lanka) -Jayawardene comes second on the list with 742 runs in 21 innings at an average of 41.22, despite not scoring any centuries in the tournament. His highest score is 84 not out, which he made against Australia in 2013. 3) Shikhar Dhawan (India) - The Indian opener is the third player to score more than 700 runs in the competition. Dhawan scored 701 runs in 10 innings at an average of 77.88. He hit three centuries in the tournament, with his highest score being 125 against Sri Lanka in 2017. 4) Kumar Sangakkara (Sri Lanka) - The wicket-keeper batter amassed 683 in 21 innings at an average of just less than 40. Sangakkara scored four fifties and one century - 134 not out against England in 2013. 5) Sourav Ganguly (India) - The former India captain scored 665 runs in the tournament in 11 innings at an average of 73.88. Gangulys highest score in the Champions Trophy - 141 not out - came against South Africa in 2000."
Top 5 Bowlers to Watch Out for in Champions Trophy 2025: Potential Game-Changers,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/five-bowlers-to-watch-out-for-champions-trophy-2025-pakistan-uae-icc-stats-records-news/article69179548.ece,"After a gap of eight years, the ICC Champions Trophy is set to return in a hybrid format with Pakistan and the UAE hosting games between February 19 and March 9, 2025. The Champions Trophy will feature eight teams, divided into two groups of four each. A total of 12 group-stage matches will be played, followed by the semifinals and final.  Here are five bowlers to look forward to during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025: Another England international born in South Africa, Brydon Carse has impressed with his hit-the-deck bowling, which will be effective during the middle overs. The 29-year-old has taken 23 wickets in 19 ODIs since an impressive debut series against Pakistan. His ability to strike the ball powerfully at the death will be an added bonus for the Jos Buttler-led side. Adam Zampa has been one of Australias best bowlers in the ODI format. The leg-spinner finished as the second-highest wicket-taker at the 2023 ODI World Cup with 21 wickets. The spinner will play a key role in subcontinent conditions and will be a perfect foil to Australias rather inexperienced pace attack. With his high point of release and the ability to move the ball off the pitch, Will ORourke can be a handful on any surface. The New Zealand pacer has 14 wickets from nine ODIs. He could be a key player for the team as it looks to transition into the post-Tim Southee and Trent Boult era. Shaheen Afridi will be crucial to Pakistans Champions Trophy title defence on home soil. His left-arm pace, swing, and variety strengthen Pakistans formidable pace attack. Coming off a strong 2024, Afridi was Pakistans leading ODI wicket-taker, playing key roles in historic series wins over Australia and South Africa. He also shared the lead as the top wicket-taker in the recent home Tri-Nation series against New Zealand and South Africa. Much of Pakistans bowling success will depend on how they utilise Afridis skills. Indias leading wicket-taker in T20Is has played only nine ODIs for the country but will have a crucial role in the upcoming tournament. The pacers ability to bowl at the death helped him edge out Mohammed Siraj for a place in the Champions Trophy squad. India will hope for early breakthroughs in the PowerPlay from the left-armer, especially with Jasprit Bumrah missing out due to injury."
ICC Champions Trophy 2025: Best bowling performances in tournament history,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/icc-champions-trophy-2025-best-bowling-figures-performance-records-stats-history/article69169075.ece,"The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy begins on February 19, with Pakistan facing New Zealand in Karachi. Eight teams will compete in two groups of four, playing 12 group-stage matches, followed by the semifinals and final. Sri Lankan pacer Farveez Maharoof holds the record for the best bowling figures in Champions Trophy history. His remarkable spell of 6/14 against West Indies in 2006 at the Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai, skittled it out for just 80. Australias Josh Hazlewood is the only other bowler to take a six-wicket haul in the tournament, achieving the feat against New Zealand in the 2017 edition. The best bowling figures by an Indian in the Champions Trophy belong to Ravindra Jadeja, who claimed 5/36 against West Indies in 2013."
Dew factor in Dubai: Why chasing teams will have the edge in 2025 Champions Trophy?,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/dubai-dew-effect-toss-winning-strategy-champions-trophy-2025/article69232679.ece,"Indias Champions Trophy 2025 campaign kicks off against Bangladesh at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium (DICS) on Friday. With all its matches scheduled at this venue, India will have to adapt to conditions that favour chasing teams and fast bowlers. Heres a look at key factors that could influence its performance. How does DICS favour chasing teams? Among venues that have hosted at least 50 ODIs, DICS has the best win-loss ratio for teams chasing. In 58 ODIs played here, the team fielding first has won 34 times. Was this trend visible in recent matches? Yes, during the ILT20 tournament, DICS hosted 15 games, and the chasing team won 11 of them, emphasising the importance of the toss. How do the pitch conditions impact bowlers? Recent months have seen pacers dominate at DICS. In the ILT20, fast bowlers claimed 116 wickets at an average of 25.80, while spinners managed only 54 wickets at 29.40. How does this affect Indias squad? India has selected five spinners  Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy, and Washington Sundar.

Champions Trophy 2025 opening ceremony: Members of Pakistan’s 2017 title-winning squad felicitated,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/champions-trophy-2025-opening-ceremony-pakistan-2017-title-winning-team-felicitated-karachi/article69231120.ece,"Members of the Pakistan squad that won the ICC Champions Trophy in England in 2017 were felicitated at the opening ceremony of the 2025 edition of the tournament in Lahore. Sarfaraz Ahmed, who was leading the team then, Mohammad Hafeez, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir, Imad Wasim, Junaid Khan, Azhar Ali, Haris Sohail attended the ceremony on Sunday and they expressed confidence in the current teams ability to defend the title. Definitely our team is very capable of defending the title we won back in 2017. We have a good tight squad but it all depends on which players perform on a given day, Sarfaraz said. Sarfaraz also made it clear Pakistan would definitely enjoy the advantage of playing at home. It is after a long time we are hosting a big ICC event so I think the support of the people and the occasion will also inspire our players to give their best, he added. He said that it was up to the captain and management to create momentum in the dressing room. Sarfaraz also termed the 2017 final against India as his most memorable match. I can never forget that match."
ICC Champions Trophy 2025: Haris Rauf resumes bowling in nets after recovering from injury,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/haris-rauf-resumes-bowling-nets-recovering-injury-pakistan-icc-champions-trophy-2025-news/article69230244.ece,"Pakistans injured fast bowler Haris Rauf said he resumed bowling in the nets on Monday and was feeling comfortable, adding that it was up to the team management to decide on his selection for the Champions Trophy opener against New Zealand. I have started doing exercises a few days back and also resumed bowling since yesterday, Haris told reporters at the National Stadium. I am feeling comfortable and my body is okay now the team management will decide about my playing in the opening match, he said. Haris, who remains one of Pakistans key fast bowlers with his express pace and ability to take wickets in the middle overs, sustained a muscular strain in his lower chest wall in the first match of the recently-held three-nation event.  But he has remained with the squad despite the selectors calling up uncapped Akif Javed as a backup after the first game against New Zealand. Haris has a haul of 83 wickets in 46 one-day internationals and another 110 wickets in 79 T20 internationals, having built his reputation as a specialist white-ball bowler. Haris also played down the presence of just one specialist spinner in the squad and noted that there were other spinners as well in Khushdil Shah, Salman Agha and Kamran Ghulam. I think we have always formed a good bowling combination with pace and spin and it will not be different in the tournament."

Steve Smith will replace Cummins at the helm for the duration of the tournament. Though it is the most successful team in the history of the ODI World Cup, Australia has had a rough time in the last two editions of the ICC Champions Trophy. It exited the tournament in 2013 and 2017 in the group stage after a number of its matches were washed out due to inclement weather.

India’s limited ODI exposure before champions trophy 2025: What it means for its chances — a statistical deep dive,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/india-champions-trophy-2025-preparation-number-of-odi-match-players-used-stats-numbers-analysis/article69229418.ece,"India will head into the 2025 Champions Trophy on the back of one of the leanest build-ups it has ever had for a multi-team event in recent years. Since its defeat in the 2023 World Cup final to Australia, India has played just nine ODIs  the fewest of any team set to take part in the Champions Trophy and the second-lowest overall, behind Ireland. To put it into context, India had played more ODIs (30) than any other team in the 12 months leading up to the previous ODI World Cup. This allowed the team to zero in on the right playing combination, enabling it to embark on a near-spotless run in the tournament. However, that has not been the case for the upcoming Champions Trophy. Despite playing just nine games, India has used 27 players in ODIs since November 19, 2023  the third-most by any team. The lack of selection clarity was evident in the first ODI against England. It began with Indias decision to select Harshit Rana over Arshdeep Singh in the playing XI, despite the former not being picked for the Champions Trophy and the latter being included. Then came the comment from Shreyas Iyer  who scored a match-winning fifty  after the game, stating that he was not supposed to play in Nagpur but was drafted in due to Virat Kohlis injury. This indicated Indias intention to break its battle-hardened ODI batting spine and introduce Yashasvi Jaiswal as Rohit Sharmas opening partner, pushing Shubman Gill and Kohli down the order. Also in the spotlight was the surprise inclusion of mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy in the ODI squad for the England series. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma hinted ahead of the opening game that the Tamil Nadu tweaker could make a late dash for the Champions Trophy squad, depending on his performances against England. Varuns last-minute introduction into the mix came on the back of his impressive performances in T20Is, which has been Indias primary focus in recent times. Since the last ODI World Cup final, India has played 38 T20Is  the second-most in the world. Interestingly, 20 of them have come after Indias T20 World Cup win in June. This is despite the fact that the next edition of the 20-over World Cup is over a year away. To top it off, India has also played 17 Tests in the last 14 months  only England has played as many red-ball games in this period. Indias lackadaisical approach to its preparation for the Champions Trophy is not just detrimental to its prospects in the tournament. With T20 franchise leagues popping up like mushrooms and Test cricket experiencing a roaring revival, the ODI format is fighting a losing battle to stay relevant. Any sign of disinterest from India, the financial powerhouse of world cricket, could be the death knell for the 50-over game. All numbers up to February 12, 2025"
Champions Trophy 2025: Watch out for these 5 game-changing batters,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/players-to-watch-in-champions-trophy-2025-batters-who-will-shine/article69229326.ece,"The Champions Trophy kicks off on 19 February as Pakistan takes on New Zealand in Karachi. Below are the five batters who could light up the stage during the course of the tournament. Fakhar Zaman (Pakistan) A key figure in Pakistans 2017 triumph, Fakhar has 3,627 runs in 85 ODIs at an average of 46.50, including a highest score of 210*. After overcoming injury setbacks, he is back in form and ready to shine. Daryl Mitchell (New Zealand) With 1,765 runs in 45 matches at an impressive average of 50.42, Mitchell thrives in Asian conditions. His 552-run World Cup 2023 campaign proved his ability to anchor and accelerate innings. Heinrich Klaasen (South Africa) A destructive middle-order batter, Klaasen has 2,074 runs in 58 matches at 44.12, boasting one of the highest strike rates in ODI history. His power-hitting and ability to dominate spin make him a key player. Shreyas Iyer (India) Iyers 2,602 runs in 65 ODIs at 48.18 highlight his consistency. His ability to control the middle overs and deliver under pressure makes him vital to Indias campaign. Ben Duckett (England) Ben Duckett, a versatile left-hander, has scored 831 runs in 19 matches at an average of 46.16, including two centuries and six fifties. Despite limited opportunities, he has impressed with his adaptability and aggressive stroke play. His ability to adapt to different situations could make him a game-changer for England in the Champions Trophy 2025."
"ICC Champions Trophy history: key stats, top run-scorers, and biggest records",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/statsman/champions-trophy-history-key-stats-records-numbers/article69228959.ece,"ICC Champions Trophy (1998-2017)  a statistical survey  This 50-over tournament started in the late 1990s when one-day cricket was probably at its peak popularity. The ICC Champions Trophy, as we know it today, was called the ICC Knockout. The first edition was lapped up by both television viewers and the host nation Bangladesh purely for the exciting high-octave cricket it generated. The brainchild of former BCCI President and then ICC Chairman Jagmohan Dalmiya, the tournament was formed to generate some fund for the ICC coffers and bring high-quality cricket to non-Test-playing countries that would, at the time, have no other way of watching live action of any kind. Therefore, the first two editions were hosted by Bangladesh in 1998 (which became a Test nation only in 2000) and Kenya in 2000. The tournament went through changes in format and names. From the ICC Knockout, it became the Mini World Cup and has been now called the ICC Champions Trophy since 2002. The tournament was played every two years regularly till 2006. The sixth edition, which was to be held in Pakistan in 2008, had to be cancelled due to security reasons, but was finally held in South Africa in 2009. The seventh edition in 2013 was supposed to be the final tournament of this series and was to be succeeded by the ICC World Test Championship, which was proposed to start from 2017 onwards. However, since the latter did not take off for various reasons, the ICC decided to continue with the eighth edition of the tournament in 2017, especially when England came forward to host the series for the third time and the second successive time.  Apart from the sixth edition, as seen below, every tournament has a different winner. Australia, the current World Cup champion, is the only side to win the trophy outright twice, in 2006 and 2009. In 2000, New Zealand won its first-ever international cricket tournament, while the West Indies, in 2004, won its first-ever major cricket title since the 1979 World Cup. Both India and Sri Lanka shared the trophy in 2002. But India, in 2013, won it outright and was favourite four years later. However, in 2017, there was a new champion in Pakistan when it defeated India by a margin of 180 runs, which was by far the biggest-ever win in a final.  The previous eight editions of the ICC Champions Trophy saw 115 matches from 1998 to 2017, during which several records were set, as given in the tables below. The ninth edition returns to the international scene after eight long years, starting on February 19. For the next three weeks, 15 matches will be played simultaneously in Pakistan and the UAE. The final is slated for March 9, 2025.

Few expected it to go all the way, but the team rode on fine performances and jigar (sheer determination)  as the then captain Sarfaraz Ahmed later highlighted  to create history. Eight years on, Pakistan returns as defending champion and host. However, it will not enjoy a complete home advantage, as its marquee fixture against India will be played at a neutral venue in Dubai. Pakistan has named a strong squad on paper, but Saim Ayubs injury has unsettled the team combination, shifting focus back to Babar Azam and captain Mohammad Rizwan. While their recent form has raised concerns, the 50-over format could provide the platform to regain rhythm and consistency. Fakhar Zamans return after a fallout with the PCB in 2024 adds depth to the batting. Asad Shafiq, a selection committee member, suggested either Babar or Saud Shakeel could open with Fakhar, depending on conditions, opposition, and strategy. Both are capable, with Babar experienced in the role, having opened in T20Is and impressed in the Cape Town Test with two half-centuries in Ayubs absence, he said. The recall of Khushdil Shah and Faheem Ashraf has drawn criticism. Ashraf averages 10 with the bat and 47 with the ball in 34 ODIs, last played in September 2023, while Shah, with 10 ODIs, has been absent since August 2022. Despite PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvis defence of their inclusion, their impact remains uncertain. A home tri-series against New Zealand and South Africa has provided preparation, though Haris Raufs ankle injury, picked up during the series, is a concern. Pakistans pace attack, key to three successive away ODI series wins last year, will be led by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, and Mohammad Hasnain, with Abrar Ahmed the sole spinner. The absence of Sufiyan Muqeem and Shadab Khan raises questions about the lack of an additional spinner. How the team management navigates this challenge will be crucial. Pakistan must raise its game after a disappointing 2023 ODI World Cup campaign. Hosting an ICC event after nearly three decades, expectations are high among fans. Now, it is up to the players to deliver. Player to watch Returning after a hiatus, Fakhar will be key. Drawing on experience, he will aim to provide strong starts and capitalise on familiar conditions. His gritty 84 in the tri-series opener against New Zealand was a confidence booster. Although he has played just one ODI since the last World Cup, the tri-series should serve as valuable preparation. Full squad Pakistan: Mohammad Rizwan (c), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Tayyab Tahir, Faheem Ashraf, Khushdil Shah, Salman Ali Agha, Usman Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi."
"Champions Trophy 2025: India full squad, SWOT analysis, and key player to watch",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/india-team-preview-swot-analysis-champions-trophy-2025-squad-team-players-list/article69191306.ece,"Since winning the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean in June 2024, India has endured an underwhelming run of results. This has mounted pressure on coach Gautam Gambhir, who took over from Rahul Dravid after the World Cup, and skipper Rohit Sharma heading into the ICC Champions Trophy. Can Indias players get their act together and reinforce their supremacy by winning this eight-team event? While Rohit and Virat Kohli have been under scrutiny for their lean returns in recent months, the 50-over format may provide a conducive setting for the two stalwarts to free up and return to their best. If they hit their stride, along with Shubman Gill in the top three, India could dominate this tournament just as it did when hosting the 2023 ODI World Cup  until running into Australia in the final. There is also plenty of firepower in the middle order, with Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant, K.L. Rahul and Hardik Pandya all possessing the requisite skill to win matches with the bat. Jasprit Bumrahs absence from the Champions Trophy is a major blow to Indias chances. The 31-year-old, widely regarded as the best bowler in the world, has been ruled out due to a back injury. His presence would have given India a significant edge over its rivals. His ability to deliver in the PowerPlay, the middle overs, and at the death made him an indispensable asset for the team. Harshit Rana has been named as his replacement. The onus now falls on Mohammed Shami to lead the pace attack. Shami is returning from a lengthy layoff and may need some time to find his rhythm. In the spin department, Kuldeep Yadav has also been short of game time lately, having undergone groin surgery after the Test series against New Zealand in November. The calibre of these bowlers is not in question, but the fact that they are returning from injuries is far from ideal in a major tournament. Unlike the other teams that have matches at different venues, India will be based in Dubai for the entirety of the tournament. Once the Indian players acclimatise to the conditions, familiarity with the pitches and ground dimensions could work to their advantage. Indias decision to include four spin-bowling options in its squad suggests that the Dubai International Cricket Stadium pitches are likely to aid spin. If so, India has enough variety in this department to capitalise. The format of the Champions Trophy is such that one bad game could push a team to the brink of a group-stage exit. The pressure to perform for India is all the more significant, as its unforgiving fans would perceive anything less than lifting the trophy as a failure. While the clash against Pakistan has high stakes riding on it, the battle with New Zealand may be just as nerve-racking, given that the Kiwis pulled off a clean sweep in a three-match Test series in India a few months ago. As the Black Caps have demonstrated in recent years, they relish the prospect of tormenting India in conditions perceived to be in the latters favour. Player to watch By naming Gill as vice-captain for the Champions Trophy, the Indian selectors have trusted the graceful right-handed batter from Punjab. With Yashasvi Jaiswal breathing down the neck of the top order, there may have been some uncertainty about Gills place in the playing eleven had he not been appointed as Rohits deputy. Now, it is up to the 25-year-old opener to prove with his performances that he deserves superstar status. He has had his ups and downs, particularly in Tests, where an average of 35.05 does not reflect his enormous talent. To be fair to Gill, he has been exceptional in the 50-over format for India. No batter has scored more runs than Shubman Gill after 50 ODI innings. He also boasts the highest average (60.16) among all players who have amassed at least 2,000 runs in their first 50 innings. However, to indeed follow in the footsteps of Rohit and Kohli, he will need to deliver match-winning knocks in a marquee event. The Champions Trophy could be that stage. Full squad India: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd. Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy."
"ICC Champions Trophy 2025: A tournament to celebrate, a test to pass",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy/icc-champions-trophy-2025-pakistan-grounds-venues-info-update-ind-pak/article69205364.ece,"The last time Pakistan hosted an International Cricket Council (ICC) event, the internet was virtually unheard of, social media and smartphones did not exist, and Babar Azam was just two years old. It has been that long, indeed! When Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga lifted the World Cup trophy to rapturous applause at Lahores Gaddafi Stadium on March 17, 1996, few could have imagined it would take Pakistan nearly 30 years to host another major cricket tournament. While Pakistan was initially announced as a co-host for the 2011 World Cup alongside India and Sri Lanka, it was stripped of the opportunity by the ICC following the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009. That incident had a lasting impact on cricket in the country. With international teams unwilling to travel, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had to make significant efforts to keep the game alive. For more than five years, Pakistan shifted its base to the United Arab Emirates for international fixtures before gradually inviting teams back for bilateral series. Although India continues to refuse to send its team across the border, the PCB successfully hosted one leg of the 2023 Asia Cup at home, gaining some confidence from other nations. However, the Champions Trophy will be its biggest litmus test yet. Three years ago, when Pakistan was awarded the tournament, Ramiz Raja was chairman of the PCB. He believes this will boost the countrys confidence. When you host a tournament after 29 years, it is a big deal. It builds your confidence and boosts the psyche of the fans and the public that theres lots to look forward to, Ramiz told Sportstar. There is an air of happiness among the fans, and theres a lot to look forward to. However, it entails huge security provisions to ensure the tournament goes smoothly Although Pakistan will play India at a neutral venue in Dubai, the country will host a significant portion of the tournament  including the semifinal and final (unless India qualifies for the latter)  across three venues: Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi. The PCB has faced major challenges in preparing the venues within just over 100 days, despite investing approximately PKR 12 billion in renovations. While the grounds were in reasonable shape, last-minute renovation work at Gaddafi Stadium and the National Stadium continued until the deadline, with more than 250 workers toiling day and night to complete the project. The PCB ultimately unveiled the renovated Gaddafi Stadium during a tri-series involving Pakistan, New Zealand, and South Africa. It was a challenging project because many doubted it would be completed, said Mohsin Naqvi, the PCB chairman. Everyone will be remembered because it was due to your untiring effort and the help of God Almighty that this project is completed, he said as the stadium was officially reopened. While the PCB is confident of hosting a successful event, questions remain about whether the tournament will capture enough interest in Pakistan, given that the much-anticipated India-Pakistan clash will be played elsewhere. Ehsan Mani, a former ICC chairman and former chief of the PCB, has expressed disappointment with how the global body handled the situation. He believes the ICC should have engaged with representatives from the BCCI and PCB much earlier rather than leaving it until the last minute. When the tournament was awarded three years ago, and the political situation between the two countries remained tense, it was important for the ICC to plan things better and come up with a solution much earlier, Mani told this publication. With the event split into two legs, teams are also concerned about the extensive travel involved. As one administrator pointed out, It would certainly be a challenge for the teams to crisscross from one country to another and then play back-to-back games. Ramiz, however, does not see this as a significant issue. Drawing on his experience from the 1989 Nehru Cup, he recalled, I remember travelling several thousand kilometres (six cities) in about 10 days during the tournament, and even then, we went on to win. Only three venues will be hosting matches this time, so travel wont be excessive. Dubai is just a couple of hours away, and teams are used to such journeys. So, it should not matter much The ICC has scrapped its usual pre-tournament captains photoshoot and mandatory press conference to minimise travel disruptions. Another notable aspect is the absence of Indian officials from the list of 12 umpires and match referees appointed by the ICC. Javagal Srinath, the only Indian in the ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees, and Nitin Menon, Indias sole representative in the ICC Elite Panel of Umpires, have opted out, citing personal reasons. Despite the events global status, Indian fans are still unlikely to be permitted to travel to Pakistan for matches, similar to the 2023 ODI World Cup, when Pakistani fans were denied visas. However, in a positive development, some Indian journalists have now been granted visas to cover the tournament in Pakistan. This marks a shift from the 2023 World Cup, where even Pakistani media representatives faced prolonged deliberations before receiving limited visas. Local reports suggest ticket sales for Pakistans home matches have been strong, with seats for the marquee India-Pakistan clash already sold out. Until recently, doubts loomed over whether the tournament would proceed in Pakistan. But Mani remembers a time when the late Jagmohan Dalmiya led a Pakistan-India-Sri Lanka Organising Committee (PILCOM) to organise the 1996 World Cup in the subcontinent. We worked as a team. We spoke regularly and ensured that things went ahead smoothly. We all had a common goal: cricket hoga, and it will be a success for Asia. Mr Dalmiya, Mr I.S. Bindra, myself, and others regularly interacted to ensure we got the tournament in shape, Mani said. Ramiz believes the event will be crucial in changing perceptions about Pakistan, which enters the tournament as the defending champion. When you grab those centre spreads in the newspaper regularly for all the right cricketing reasons and become the centre of attraction, it not only fulfils your expectations but also allows you to dream ahead Ramiz said. Mani, however, believes that frequent visits by top teams have already helped to create a positive image of Pakistan. During my time at the PCB, from 2018 to 2021, we ensured that teams started travelling to Pakistan. Over the last few years, image-building has been done successfully, as a result of which top teams are coming in. During my time, I never heard visiting teams complain about security. They would often tell us to relax things a bit so that players could step out and enjoy themselves, Mani said, adding: With security taken care of, teams are now comfortable travelling to the country, and hopefully, the Champions Trophy will only make things better After three decades of waiting, Pakistans fans finally have something to celebrate."
"India Nets: Shami works on lengths with Morkel, Pant recovers after freak hit by Hardik shot",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/india-nets-session-shami-bowling-kohli-rohit-drills-pant-accident-pandya-ind-vs-ban-champions-trophy-2025/article69227037.ece,"A focussed Mohammed Shami spent considerable time with bowling coach Morne Morkel as a full-strength Indian team started its training in earnest ahead of its Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh at the picturesque ICC Academy practice ground in Dubai on Sunday. With the new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) strictly in place, there was no question of an optional session, and right from skipper Rohit Sharma to the youngest Harshit Rana, the entire squad was present where Shamis routines were interesting. Having recently made his international comeback against England in both T20Is and ODIs, the stretchable knee caps did not go unnoticed as he first tried to get a feel of the conditions by bowling a few deliveries with a short run-up. He looked gingerly in his initial strides even as others engaged in their physical drills while a few others engaged in some fun activities aimed at improving anticipation and decision-making.  Before the batters entered the nets, Shami was trying to adjust his length and walked up towards the batters end in the net with bowling coach Morne Morkel in tow. From a distance, it seemed that he was discussing the ideal length as he stood on the popping crease at the batters end. Shami was seen pointing at a certain length outside the batters crease, which could be termed a good length (4m to 6m) region. He gestured to indicate that he was trying to move the ball from that particular length as Morkel listened to him intently. Once the batters joined the nets, Shami was seen bowling full tilt and on occasions, did hurry the batters. Hardik Pandya and Shreyas Iyer were seen depositing Kuldeep Yadav and other spinners over the fence on multiple occasions. One such powerful hit from Pandya caused a minor but freakish accident as Rishabh Pant was hit on the knee. He was in pain, but the physio Kamlesh Jain tended to him with a concerned Pandya coming out of the nets to check on his junior colleague. But it didnt turn out to be a serious issue as Pant padded up soon after the first team batters were finished with their sessions. Kohli, as usual, looked a picture of concentration during the nets. Rohit had a spring in his step and seemed to be in a good mood after a match-winning century against England in Cuttack last week. When the main batters were at the nets, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy and Pant were doing fielding drills with coach T Dilip. They engaged in some single-action pick-up and throws. It also indicated that the troika was perhaps not in the scheme of things as far as the first game against Bangladesh on February 20 is concerned.  The entire team seemed to be in good spirits as Kohli was seen joking during the fun activity, which was unique in its own way. One among Rohit or Virat was sending a tennis ball with a racquet soaring, and instead of catching, the first guy, who would be wearing a helmet, came under the ball and headed it. A wicked deviation would require the second man to catch it. There are times when innovative game drills are introduced by Strength and Conditioning coaches to beat monotony. There is no specific purpose but an innovative way of warming up other than playing football. And if you ask about the broader goal, you can say that once the first guy heads it, others have to have their instincts up as the ball can come towards anyone, and he has to react, a well-known strength and conditioning coach told PTI."

These events are great to be a part of and its in front of these guys now, Im very excited to see how they go. The way the team has played, different guys have stepped up. Its a good mix between some experienced guys and some exciting young guys with a lot of potential, Southee was quoted as saying in a ICC press release. The experience of this Tri-Nation Series is only going to stand them in good stead for the tournament. So, taking some momentum into the tournament and being accustomed to those conditions, its only going to be a good thing, Southee said. Southee, who has 221 ODI wickets, feels ORourke has the potential to become the backbone of the New Zealand attack in the coming days. Will ORourke, in the Test game weve seen what he can do. Hes still so young but hes got all the attributes that are going to set him up to have a lot of success in international cricket. Im looking forward to watching him in his first ICC event. Will is a man of few words but certainly listens and wants to get better. We know hes got the pace and bounce, hes got great skills. He just keeps growing, weve seen that in the Test game and hes continued to get better. His game is far from finished but Im sure hell be a massive asset to New Zealand cricket across all three formats for a long time to come. He also reserved some praise for Nathan Smith. Nathan Smith has a real confidence about him, and believes in himself which I think you need at this level. Southee is also happy that veteran Kane Williamson is in fine nick, which will boost New Zealands chances. Kane is in good form. Its nice to see him with a couple of scores. Hes obviously class. Hes not played a lot of one-day cricket for the last few years but to see him come back and have two significant contributions is what were used to seeing. But its also pleasing for me now as a fan of the Black Caps. When he (Williamson) is in the middle, it comes with experience and the way he plays, he just looks in control the whole time. Williamson, Devon Conway, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips form the backbone of New Zealands batting and Southee believes that the five are better judges of how to pace their innings in the 50-over format. That is what sets those four or five batters apart from the rest. They are able to sum up conditions, sum up moments in games and more times than not, they come out on the right side of things. He (Williamson) brings a calmness to the group. Southee also praised left-arm spinner Mitchell Santners leadership skills. Mitch has done a great job as captain. Its still reasonably new to him but I experienced a bit of his captaincy towards the end of my career. Hes very calm, you see that in the way he plays his cricket. He thinks about the game well and I think he looks to lead with his performances across all three areas. Hes one of best fielders, an unbelievably skilful bowler and a more-than-useful batter. So, Im sure hell be looking to lead in all those three areas. So, can New Zealand go all the way and follow in the footsteps of the 2000 vintage? Southee certainly thinks so. If you look at the track record of New Zealand in ICC events, they are always there or thereabouts. In a tournament like the Champions Trophy, if you get on a bit of a roll, anything can happen. Id love to see the Black Caps there and hopefully lifting the trophy at the end."

New Zealand’s Ravindra back at training after hit in face by ball but unlikely to play Champions Trophy opener against Pakistan,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/rachin-ravindra-hit-in-face-injury-update-new-zealand-vs-pakistan-odi-tri-series-final/article69218056.ece,"New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra has eased back into training after being struck in the face by the ball in a fielding mishap, but he still has concussion protocols to pass before returning to the field, coach Gary Stead said. Ravindra lost sight of the ball in the floodlights when attempting a catch and was hit in the forehead during the ODI Tri nation series match, a warmup for the Champions Trophy 2025, against Pakistan in Lahore last Saturday. Though Ravindra passed his first Head Injury Assessment (HIA) immediately after the blow, Stead revealed the 25-year-old had suffered headaches in the following days and would need to tick off further HIAs to be passed fit. He will therefore play no part in the tri-series final against Pakistan in Karachi later on Friday and appears unlikely to be selected for the Champions Trophy opener against the host next Wednesday in the same city. Hes had a headache for a few days but thats, I guess, subsiding which is really good news, Stead said in Karachi, declining to put a time-line on Ravindras return. He had a few balls tonight for the first time, which is good, but theres still a few more steps for him to go through before he would be considered fit to play. There was better news for pace bowler Lockie Ferguson, who Stead expected to return to action for Sundays Champions Trophy warmup against Afghanistan in Karachi, if not for the tri-series final. Ferguson suffered a hamstring strain while playing in the United Arab Emirates ILT20 competition. Having played plenty of cricket in Pakistan and with star batter Kane Williamson firing on all cylinders, New Zealand will head into the rebooted Champions Trophy hopeful of winning its second title and first since the 2000 tournament in Kenya."

The Indian duo closed in on star Pakistan batter Babar Azam who maintained a narrow lead at the top of the chart. Gill, who made 112 in the Ahmedabad ODI on Wednesday, is just five rating points adrift of Babar, while Rohit is within 13 rating points of the Pakistan right-hander following his splendid century (119) in Cuttack on February 9. With just one week remaining until the start of the Champions Trophy in Pakistan and the UAE, it sets up a tight race for the premier position for batters in 50-over cricket during the eight-team tournament.  Fakhar Zaman (13th), Kane Williamson (29th), Jos Buttler (38th), Devon Conway (equal 40th) and Joe Root (51st) are among the big names to re-enter the rankings for ODI batters following a recent return to 50-over cricket, while things are equally as tight near the top of the bowling ranks. Just 18 rating points separates Rashid Khan, Maheesh Theekshana, Bernard Scholtz, Shaheen Afridi and Kuldeep Yadav in the top five for ODI bowlers, while the Indian duo of Ravindra Jadeja (11th) and Mohammed Shami (13th) sit just outside the top 10 following a recent return against England. Afghanistan veteran Mohammad Nabi maintains a narrow lead at the top of the ODI rankings for all-rounders, with New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner (up two places to seventh) among the biggest movers this week ahead of the Champions Trophy."
Pakistan hopeful Champions Trophy 2025 will bring more big events,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/international/pakistan-champions-trophy-2025-pcb-venues-mohsin-naqvi-safety-uae-match-india-cricket-news/article69215047.ece,"Pakistan will host its first major multi-country cricket tournament in nearly three decades next week, and its cricket chief is hopeful that a successful Champions Trophy will bring a flood of other such events. Top teams shunned Pakistan after the 2009 attack on a bus carrying Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore, forcing it to relocate home matches, mostly to the United Arab Emirates. It took the Pakistan Cricket Board years to convince foreign counterparts that it was safe to visit. Touring sides began returning after the board successfully staged its own T20 league, with several foreign players, on home soil in 2017. The ICC (International Cricket Council) Champions Trophy 2025 is a culmination of those efforts, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi told Reuters. Our successful hosting of this event will further enhance Pakistans credentials, positioning us as a strong contender for more ICC events in the next events cycle, he added.  Pakistan staged the 1996 World Cup after winning the previous edition of crickets marquee event but the countrys fortunes crumbled with the rise of militancy following war in neighbouring Afghanistan. Security has long ceased to be a concern for visiting teams as we have consistently demonstrated our ability to provide a safe, secure and well-managed environment for international cricket, said Naqvi, who also doubles as the countrys internal security chief. Once we successfully staged home international series and consistently delivered PSL (Pakistan Super League) editions at world-class standards, the ICC accepted and recognised Pakistans readiness to host a global event, he said. Since 2019, all major Test-playing nations - except India - have toured Pakistan, some multiple times, he added. Naqvi said multiple visits by England and New Zealand and the growing number of international players in the PSL were an endorsement. As a result, they are already familiar with Pakistans world-class playing conditions, operational efficiency and robust security measures. But he acknowledged that staging a multi-team event was tougher than hosting a single team. The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 has been a monumental task, requiring extensive preparations in a limited timeframe. Our stadiums last underwent significant renovations for the 1996 World Cup, and since then, the global cricketing landscape has evolved tremendously, Naqvi said. The PCB has upgraded two main grounds in Karachi and Lahore for the event in an 11th-hour facelift."
Australia’s Spencer Johnson sees chance to shine while ‘Big Three’ quicks away,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/spencer-johnson-australia-left-arm-pacer-champions-trophy-2025-team-odi-career-numbers-stats/article69214414.ece,"Australian cricket fans may have seen few positives from the stinging ODI defeat to Sri Lanka on Wednesday but left-arm pacer Spencer Johnson may look back at the match as an important ice-breaker in his fledgling international career. Nearly a year-and-a-half on from his ODI debut against India in Indore, the 29-year-old South Australian finally celebrated his first wicket in the 50-over format when he had opener Pathum Nissanka caught behind on the fifth ball in Colombo. It was a long time to wait for a maiden dismissal but more a reflection of the paucity of opportunity that Australias next-gen quicks have been dealt while toiling in the shadow of the Big Three -- Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. Johnson is a coveted player on the T20 franchise circuit and took a million-dollar contract to play in the 2024 Indian Premier League.  But Wednesdays match was just his third ODI, coming while Cummins, Hazlewood and Starc are all unavailable due to injuries or personal reasons. Johnson did his best to emulate fellow left-armer Starc as he steamed in to capture a first-over wicket. He finished with 2-44 from seven overs. Its obviously something Ive pictured in my mind, to come in and play a similar role to (Starc), Johnson told reporters on Thursday. There were a few nerves there, and obviously big shoes to fill but Im better for the run. Its only my third ODI so hopefully a few more, and hopefully I can replicate some of the stuff hes done. The Sri Lanka result was viewed dimly by home media as a depleted Australia warm up for the Champions Trophy which starts next week in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. But the fast bowling unit of Johnson, Nathan Ellis (2-23) and Sean Abbott (3-61) held up their end in Colombo as Sri Lanka were dismissed for a modest total of 214 despite a fighting century from their captain Charith Asalanka. With Travis Head rested, it was Australias relatively experienced batting lineup that fell in a heap to be out for 165. Australia will play a second ODI against Sri Lanka on Friday, their last warmup before heading to the Champions Trophy where it meets England in their first match in Lahore. Johnson will hope to deliver bags of wickets in Pakistan to prove he is more than just a seat-warmer until the champion quicks return. I think it is in my hands really, he said. If I perform, then Ill be around ... but its up to performances."
"IND vs ENG: We’ve not been near our potential, says England skipper Jos Buttler",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/india-vs-england-odi-series-jos-buttler-potential-champions-trophy-preparation-ind-v-eng/article69213953.ece,"England captain Jos Buttler on Wednesday said his units 0-3 reverse at the hands of India does not derail its preparation for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy. Obviously, you want the results now to build confidence and win. It feels a lot better to sit here [and answer] having won matches as opposed to losing, but we were up against a good side in their own conditions. Theyre probably the benchmark really in ODI cricket at the moment. Weve not been near our potential, individually or collectively, or where we can be and that gives us something to look forward to and believe that we can get there and be a dangerous team in the championship, Buttler said after the 142-run defeat in Ahmedabad. Setting out to chase 357, the side stormed to 84/2 in 10 overs before a flurry of wickets in the middle order sent the innings into a tailspin. Reflecting on where his team lost the plot, Buttler said: Probably a bit of a similar theme, from this series and the whole tour. We had a couple of moments in the game, but never enough to go on and force a result or win against a really good team.  England won the toss and batted in the opening two games, but opted to bowl in Ahmedabad. A part of it was in anticipation of dew under the lights, which would ease chasing. But Buttler added the decision also came from the viewpoint of testing the side under all scenarios. We wanted to bowl first having not not done that in the previous couple of games. But also, potentially this is a good place to chase. The dew comes in a little bit here but they put a really good score on the board. Its always gonna be tough, Buttler said. Buttler also reposed faith in his batting lineup that failed to match its counterpart throughout the series. No concerns. We simply just have to be better. No, we have to be very confident in all the guys games against spin. Our guys have all the shots. Joe Root is probably one of the best players of spin in the world. Quite simply, you cant always put your finger on why; but we just have to be more effective. And like I said, take lessons from the opposition. Shubman Gill goes on and gets a hundred today. Robert Sharma did it in the last game. Shubman early in the first game scored 90 or nearly 100. Theyre the kind of contributions you need in ODI cricket to go on and win games, Buttler said."

Bumrah, despite being named in the provisional squad, failed to make the cut, leading to the BCCI announcing Harshit Rana as Bumrahs replacement. The eight-nation tournament will begin on February 19 in Karachi, with host Pakistan facing New Zealand in the opening match. Earlier, Bumrah was named in Indias 15-member squad for the Champions Trophy despite concerns over his recovery from an injury sustained during the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.  Bumrah, who was at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru, underwent several scans. Indias ODI and Test captain, Rohit Sharma, had stated that the team management was awaiting the scan results for better clarity regarding his back injury. We are waiting for some updates on his scan, which are due over the next few days. Once we receive the scan report, we will have more clarity on where he stands right now and whether he will be available for the last ODI, Rohit had said ahead of the India versus England ODI series. Bumrahs absence will be a significant setback for India. The right-arm pacer was in exceptional form during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, taking 32 wickets across five matches at an average of 13.06 to earn the Player of the Series award. Bumrah carried a heavy workload in Australia, bowling 151.2 overs  the most by any Indian bowler in the series  including more than 50 overs in the fourth Test in Melbourne. He was also instrumental in Indias success at the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he was named Player of the Series after taking 15 wickets at a remarkable average of 8.26 and an economy rate of 4.17.

Though India has already taken a 2-0 unassailable lead in the three-match series, the Rohit Sharma-led side will look to make the most of what is its last competitive match before the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which begins later this month. LIVE UPDATES - IND vs ENG 3rd ODI The Men in Blue will also have an opportunity to exorcise the ghosts of the past as their last ODI at this venue ended in heartbreak, with Australia clinching a six-wicket win in the 2023 Cricket World Cup final. Overall, India has won 11 out of 20 ODIs it has played at this venue. Ahead of the World Cup final defeat in 2023, India was on a five-match winning streak at the venue in the 50-over format. The conditions at the Narendra Modi Stadium have historically favoured the bowlers in one-dayers. In 31 ODIs held at the venue, the 300-run mark has been breached just six times. The last time a team scored 300 or more in an innings here was back in 2010, when South Africa smashed 365 for two in 50 overs against India. In the 13 ODIs held here since, no team has gone past the 300-run figure. The seamers are likely to dominate at the Narendra Modi Stadium, having picked up 257 wickets at an average of 32.31 in all ODIs held here. On the other hand, though the spinners have been slightly more economical, they have only managed 137 wickets at 39.67 runs apiece. The team that has won the toss has gone on to win the match 18 times out of the 31 matches held here. However, in the last 10 ODIs at the venue, the team losing the toss has won six games. Thus, the flip of the coin is unlikely to play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the match. However, as there is always a chance of dew setting in during the second innings, teams have opted to chase in seven of the last 10 ODIs held at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Moreover, four of the last five ODIs here have been won by the team batting second."

If we lose 3-0 to India, I dont care as long as we beat them in the final of the Champions Trophy, said Duckett, a left-hand batsman. If we do that, we probably wont look back on this if we do the business in that competition. Englands tour of India has been Brendon McCullums first assignment as coach of the white-ball team. He started with a 4-1 loss in the T20 internationals. The defeats followed in the two ODI matches as well despite England being in good positions with bat and ball in both games. Its about peaking at the right time, said Duckett. We have been close against this India side, and we have been nowhere near our best. We will always take positives. He added: We could dwell, start meetings and going at each other but the group under Baz (McCullum) arent going to do that. Its difficult not to get the results here, but hopefully, we can turn it around in Pakistan."
Virat Kohli is world’s best player regardless of form: Chris Gayle,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/virat-kohli-best-player-in-the-world-chris-gayle-champions-trophy-record-former-rcb-teammate/article69206553.ece,"Virat Kohli may have been going through a poor run of form but the senior Indian batter remains the best player in the world, feels former West Indies batter Chris Gayle. The 36-year-old Kohli endured yet another poor outing as he was dismissed for just five runs in the second ODI against England in Cuttack on Sunday. But Gayle, who has played alongside Kohli at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Indian Premier League (IPL), remains unperturbed by the Indians lean stretch. He is still the best player in the world regardless of the form. Virat Kohli is still the best player, the stats prove that. How many centuries across formats he has scored as well, Gayle said on the sidelines of an event here on Tuesday. Its just one of those things that we cricketers go through in patches. I know it is coming at the back end of his career as well, but these things do happen, so he just needs to pick himself up and come back again. Kohli has been struggling for runs in international cricket of late, but he was expected to find form in the ODIs, which he has dominated like no other for the longest time. Kohlis return to the format, however, was not a great one as he was caught behind off Adil Rashid in the second match after missing the opening game due to a sore knee. Asked if Kohli can break Gayles record for most number of runs scored in the Champions Trophy, he said, It is easy for him just to get 200 runs (more to surpass Gayle). I dont know how many games they will be playing but I am sure he can get over 200 runs, and I am sure he will get a century for sure, so its just a matter of time before he goes on to break that record. Known for his flamboyance besides his big-hitting capabilities, Gayle called Indian captain Rohit Sharma the new king in town after the Mumbaikar broke the Jamaicans record for hitting the most number of sixes in the ODI format. Congratulations to Rohit. Sports always need a new entertainer and Rohit has been entertaining all these years as well I have done it alongside him. So, he is the new king in town now. So, congrats to him, and hopefully, he goes on to hit more sixes. Asked about youngster Abhishek Sharmas blistering hundred against England in the fifth T20I, Gayle said, I heard about his innings, it was a cracking innings and for a youngster to do such a thing on an international platform is huge and fantastic. Gayle also expressed his disappointment at West Indies absence in the Champions Trophy. I am disappointed, no West Indies in the Champions Trophy but it is good to have the Champions Trophy back, so I am looking forward to it. Hopefully, it will be an entertaining one. I know it is actually taking place in Pakistan and Dubai, so hopefully, we will have some entertaining cricket. Asked to pick his semifinalists for the event starting February 19, Gayle said, Im going to be going off just my mind  India, England, Australia, and probably New Zealand."
SL vs AUS 1st ODI: Australia looks to fine-tune for Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka one-dayers,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/sl-vs-aus-1st-odi-champions-trophy-2025-preparation-australia-tour-of-sri-lanka-steve-smith-captain/article69206290.ece,"Captain Steve Smith admitted on Tuesday the Champions Trophy would be on Australias mind when it plays Sri Lanka in two One-Day Internationals this week, the final warm-ups for the eight-team tournament. The Champions Trophy begins on February 19 in Pakistan and Dubai, and 50-over world champion Australia is in a group with England, South Africa and Afghanistan. Australia faces Sri Lanka in Colombo on Wednesday and Friday, fresh from a dominant 2-0 Test series sweep. Id be lying if I said the Champions Trophy wasnt at the forefront of our minds - its a massive ICC tournament for us, Smith told reporters in Colombo. While our focus is firmly on finishing this series on a strong note, there is no denying that the Champions Trophy is looming large. We want to make sure we carry good form into that competition. Both ODIs will be played as day games, a rarity in modern cricket. The floodlights in Colombos R. Premadasa Stadium are out of action as part of renovations ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted with India. Day games are quite different, Smith said, adding he couldnt remember his last ODI day match. But whatever the conditions, its going to be warm out there, and were looking forward to the challenge. Before coming to Sri Lanka, Australia held a training camp in Dubai to prepare for challenging wickets in Sri Lanka, said Smith. The batters found methods to succeed in these conditions, the spinners worked on varying their pace, and the seamers fine-tuned their reverse swing, he said. We hope to bring all that into this series and finish well. Sri Lanka did not qualify for the Champions Trophy after a dismal ninth-place finish at the World Cup in India in 2023. Its disappointing, no doubt about it - but theres nothing that we can do about it now, Sri Lankas stand-in captain Charith Asalanka said. Whats important is that we make sure this never happens again. Asalanka said the team wanted to focus on its successes - including beating India in 2024 in the first ODI in 27 years. We need to build on that momentum, Asalanka added."
Reshuffled Australia weighs Champions Trophy candidates against Sri Lanka,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/australia-champions-trophy-2025-team-squad-selection-sri-lanka-series-head-smith-captain-injuries/article69206024.ece,"After sweeping the test series in Sri Lanka, an injury-depleted Australia will look to carry the momentum into ODI matches against the South Asians and build confidence ahead of the Champions Trophy. Selectors will confirm Australias final Champions Trophy squad on Wednesday as a bevy of fringe players look to impress in the first of two ODIs against Sri Lanka in Colombo. With the Sri Lanka tour following a long, attritional home summer, Australias Champions Trophy roster will have a different look to the peerless squad that took a record-extending sixth World Cup title at the 2023 tournament in India. Regular captain Pat Cummins, fellow quick Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Mitch Marsh have been ruled out with injuries, while Marcus Stoinis was a late withdrawal last week after his surprise retirement from ODIs. Selectors responded by calling up a small army of reserves for the Sri Lanka series, adding fast bowlers Sean Abbott, Spencer Johnson and Ben Dwarshuis along with legspinner Tanveer Sangha, spin-bowling all-rounder Cooper Connolly and batter Jake Fraser-McGurk. Selectors have yet to decide on Cummins replacement as captain, though coach Andrew McDonald confirmed it will be either Steve Smith, who led the test side in Cumminss absence, or Travis Head. Other selections remain up in the air even if fresh faces in the bowling are guaranteed. The international ambitions of Australias reserve quicks have long been thwarted by the durability and consistency of the front-line trio of Cummins, Hazlewood and Starc.  However, at least two of Abbott, Johnson and Dwarshuis are expected to be included in the Champions Trophy, joining pacers Mitchell Starc and Nathan Ellis for the tournament co-hosted by Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. With Starc almost certain to be rested for Wednesdays ODI due to the quick turnaround from the second test, fellow left-armers Johnson and Dwarshuis may hope for a last chance to impress selectors in his place. The hard-hitting Fraser-McGurk is in line to replace Marsh at number three in the batting order, while Connolly may be retained in the Champions Trophy squad as a replacement for Stoinis even if he lacks the all-rounders seam bowling. Selectors want all of Australias test players included in the ODI squad to play at least one of the Colombo matches to get into the rhythm of the shorter format, even if the venues spin-friendly conditions may be quite different to those in Pakistan. Australia opens its Champions Trophy campaign against England in Lahore on Feb. 22, with it other group matches against South Africa and Afghanistan also in Pakistan. McDonald said it would be a fine balance tuning up the squad for the Feb. 19-March 9 tournament as the selectors look to pick a team that can continue to build momentum in Sri Lanka. You want to play to win, theres no doubt about that because winning form always helps the confidence of a group, he told Cricket Australias website. The consideration is the conditions (in Colombo) are potentially somewhat different to what we get in Pakistan. Last time we came here (in 2022) it spun square in the one-day series, so hopefully theyre flatter surfaces for us to prepare, but who knows."
South Africa could end ICC trophy drought this year: Graeme Smith,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/south-africa-icc-title-drought-champions-trophy-2025-wtc-final-graeme-smith-former-captain-sa20-league/article69205882.ece,"Former captain Graeme Smith is optimistic that South Africa will end its prolonged wait for an ICC trophy this year, long before it hosts the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup in 2027. With the eight-team Champions Trophy beginning on February 19 and the World Test Championship (WTC) final scheduled for June this year, Smith believes South Africa is on the brink of breaking its ICC trophy drought. Hopefully, we will end that wait much before the 2027 World Cup, with the Champions Trophy and WTC final coming up but if South Africa could win a WC trophy in front of a home crowd, it would be amazing, Smith, who serves as SA20 commissioner, told PTI Bhasha. Over the next three years, we want to just keep pushing to improve our stadiums, pitches and our cricket ecosystem, so that by the time we host the 2027 WC, we are the favorites. South Africa finished as runner-up at both the mens and Womens T20 World Cups in 2024. Earlier this year, it was also defeated by India in the ICC Womens Under-19 World Cup final. However, the Proteas have a chance to lift spirits in the country as they prepare to face Australia in the WTC final this June. This will be their first appearance in the summit clash, having secured their spot after a crucial win over Pakistan in the Boxing Day Test in Centurion. Many believe South Africa had an easier run to the finals, having beaten teams such as India, West Indies, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. However, Smith, who boasts 9,265 runs in 117 Tests and 6,986 runs in 197 ODIs, dismissed the claims. There is no smooth journey in cricket today. You have got to do what you got to do. Right in the beginning, everyone knew who they were playing and who they were not playing. South Africa has won seven Test matches in a row to qualify. Everyone should look into the Test ecosystem, how it works as you play what you have been told to play in that cycle. On the ongoing country vs club debate, Smith acknowledged the rise of T20 cricket but stressed the importance of creating a sustainable model where all member boards collaborate. I want to see Test cricket stay stronger and if we can keep it strong with at least six or seven nations, that way Test cricket will stay strong, Smith, who led South Africa to a record 54 Test victories, said. I often say that T20 cricket has to grow. We have seen it moving into America and also in lots of new regions. We will see it in the Olympics now. What amazes me is that how many cricket fans it has pulled. I think franchise cricket will probably end up having three or four outstanding leagues in the world, with maybe a tier-two system. But in the future, its more about all the member boards working together to keep each other strong. Smith also highlighted the role of scheduling in ensuring financial stability. Scheduling also helps the revenue model. India is amazing as they tour frequently, providing revenue that keeps nations afloat. But if England and Australia continue playing only each other and not engaging with African or other nations, it gets harder because Test cricket is commercially under pressure, he said. If you look at how the money flows and the expenses, it puts Test cricket under strain. Its about working together and creating a model that can keep the game sustainable, he added."
VIDEO | India will need both Rohit and Virat to fire to win Champions Trophy: Muralitharan,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/videos/watch-video-interview-muttiah-muralitharan-virat-kohli-rohit-sharma-form-champions-trophy-2025-india-chances/article69202839.ece,"India will need both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to be in form in order to win the Champions Trophy, said Sri Lanka spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan, adding that teams from the subcontinent will have more balanced bowling attacks in the competition. The form of Rohit and Kohli has dominated the talk in the build-up to the eight-nation tournament which gets underway on February 19. While Rohit banished his batting woes with his 32nd ODI ton on Sunday against England, Kohli is yet to fire since his 100 not out in the Perth Test against Australia in November. Definitely, because they are world-class players. Always say class is permanent (and) form is only temporary. So they will come to the (batting) form, Muralitharan told PTI Videos in an exclusive interaction. Rohit has scored a hundred and Virat will also will come to form. Definitely, they need to be in form in this tournament for India to win, he added. Muralitharan said the teams from the subcontinent will have a balanced attack for the conditions on offer in Pakistan and UAE. Its (spin bowling) more important because wickets will help the spinners in Pakistan, even in the UAE. I think spinners will play a big role in this tournament, he said. There are a lot of good spinners in the world because if you take India, there are about four spinners in the squad and if you take Afghanistan, they (also) have a good spin attack (and) even Bangladesh. Every subcontinent country has good spinners, he added. India has an all-round attack because they got very good spinners and fast bowlers as well. Even Pakistan has also got the same. These subcontinent countries have a balanced attack for this kind of playing conditions, Muralitharan said."
Sunil Gavaskar: India will start as firm favourites to win ICC Champions Trophy 2025,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/sunil-gavaskar-india-favourites-win-icc-champions-trophy-2025-rohit-sharma-form-captain-ind-vs-eng-virat-kohli-bumrah-injury/article69202168.ece,"The Indian skipper, Rohit Sharma, hitting a sparkling century was perhaps even more reason for celebration than India winning the match and, with it, another one-day series, against England. Cricket is a team game for sure, but its also important, especially ahead of a world tournament like the ICC Champions Trophy, for the lead actors to show that they are in good form and raring to go. Rohit is perhaps the most destructive opening batter in the one-day game, and his striking form is a vital ingredient if India are hoping to regain the Trophy that they won way back in 2013. Not many batters have hit multiple double-hundreds in this format, and Rohit is one of those rare batters who has done so. The reason it is also crucial for the captain of the team to be in form is that he is able to make good decisions while under pressure. Tough situations require bold calls, and if a captain is doing well personally, then he is not thinking of the ramifications of a bold tactical move going wrong. The move works again because when a captain is in great touch, the gut feel, which is an important part of taking the decision, turns right more often than not. Look at the calls that Suryakumar Yadav made last year in Sri Lanka when he was captaining the team. In a situation where the Lankans were cruising to a win, he brought on Rinku Singh and himself, and both picked wickets and won the game for India. Both hardly ever bowl when they are playing under other captains, but SKY, with his flair for doing the unusual with the bat, also brought out that aspect in his tactical approach since he was full of confidence, and it worked. In a competition like the Champions Trophy, where only the top ICC-ranked teams participate, there is less likelihood of an easy game and more chances of tight finishes, and it is for these situations that a captain needs to be mentally sharp. Rohit has often shown that he leads by instinct, which has worked very well for him, and now that all the questions about his place in the team have been hit for a massive six with that magnificent century, he will also lead with the weight of worrying for a place in the team off his shoulders. The wins in the T20 series as well as the ODI series put India in a great place as far as confidence is concerned. There are only a couple of loose ends to be tied up, and that is Jasprit Bumrahs availability for the Champions Trophy and Virat Kohli getting back among the hundreds, as Rohit has done. Kohli is a big-match player, and nothing will motivate him more than the opportunity to score runs and win the Champions Trophy for India. After the last Champions Trophy win in 2013, he celebrated with the Gangnam dance, which was the rage way back then. This time, if he helps India win, we could be in for another unique celebration from him. Its been just over a month since Bumrah had his back issue in Sydney, and hopefully, he will be fit for the tournament. His presence almost guarantees wickets at the start and also in the final overs, apart from his miserly allowance of runs to the opposition batters. The pitch in Dubai will certainly be a little bouncier and, with it, have more carry than the ones India has played on in the recent series. Thats why his presence is so vital for Indias chances. Mohammed Shamis return to the team has also been most encouraging, and one can see that he is regaining his rhythm and pace. The other heartening aspect of Indias cricket in the series has been the outstanding catches taken by the fielders. Yes, there have been some simple catches floored too, but overall, the fielding has been top-class, with maybe just one fielder to hide. That, though, is a situation for all the teams in the world, where one of their bowlers is a weak link in the fielding unit. Good captains will see who is bowling and hide those fielders in positions where the ball is less likely to go. The spirit in the team is very good, as could be seen by their enthusiastic cheering of their teammates who won individual awards at the recent annual BCCI awards function. A team that is laughing with each other is a happy team that will invariably try and play for each other. Thats why India, apart from the talent that they have, will start as firm favourites to win the ICC Champions Trophy once again."
"Pakistan is a dangerous side in home conditions, should make Champions Trophy 2025 semifinals: Ravi Shastri",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/pakistan-champions-trophy-2025-dangerous-side-ravi-shastri-semifinal-players-home-condition/article69202027.ece,"Armed with a fearsome pace attack and playing in home conditions, hosts Pakistan could be a force to reckon with in the Champions Trophy even though it will miss opener Saim Ayub, reckons former India coach Ravi Shastri. Defending champion Pakistan heads into the Champions Trophy riding high on three consecutive ODI series victories over South Africa, Zimbabwe and Australia. I think Pakistan are the kind of side that, with the exposure theyve had in the last six to eight months in white-ball cricket, have put up some really strong performances, especially in South Africa, Shastri told The ICC Review. Despite the absence of the injured Ayub, who has become a vital cog in the Pakistan side, Shastri remains confident in the teams depth. Theyve missed Ayub at the top, and hes a crucial player. But Pakistan have enough depth to be dangerous, especially in home conditions. I would say they should qualify for the semi-finals and from there, its anyones game. Shastri is certain that, should Pakistan make it to the knockout stages, they will be a formidable threat to any team. Pakistan are still very, very dangerous, and if they qualify, theyll be doubly more dangerous. Echoing Shastris thoughts, Australian legend Ricky Ponting focused on Pakistans lethal pace attack that includes Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain.  I agree with Ravi. Saim Ayub is a high-quality player, and his absence is a massive gap to fill, Ponting said. But Pakistans fast bowling brigade is very, very good. Led by Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, whove been terrific in recent series, they have the pace and skill to trouble any batting line-up. Since returning from South Africa, where he notched three consecutive fifties, former skipper Babar Azams form has dipped. Ponting said his form will be crucial for Pakistan. Babar has been a bit up and down in recent years, but if he and (Mohammad) Rizwan can bring their A-games, thats when Pakistan becomes incredibly dangerous, Ponting said. Theyve still got enough high-quality players to beat any team on any given day. If they play well, theyll be right in it. Ponting also acknowledged the added dimension that playing in front of a home crowd can bring. The pressure of playing at home can work both ways. It can be a real motivator, especially with the home crowd behind you. That support can sometimes help you cross the line in big moments, Ponting said. Pakistan will begin its Champions Trophy campaign against New Zealand in Karachi on February 19 before taking on arch rival India on February 23 in Dubai."
"IND vs ENG: If even Rohit Sharma can be under pressure, we should be easier on ourselves, says Buttler",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/rohit-sharma-hundred-form-india-vs-england-cuttack-jos-buttler-praise-pressure-ind-v-eng/article69201552.ece,"If a player of Rohit Sharmas calibre could face pressure at times, the others should be a bit easier on themselves, said England skipper Jos Buttler as he hailed the Indian skippers much-awaited century as a lesson in modern and dynamic ODI batting. Facing intense scrutiny over his form and calls of retirement, the 37-year-old Rohit returned to form with his first century in the ODI format in 16 months to power India to a series-clinching win here on Sunday. Its probably a nice reminder for all of us that if someone of Rohits caliber can be under pressure, we should be a bit easier on ourselves, Buttler said after their four-wicket loss here. Hes been a great player for such a long period of time and top players generally come up with the goods and he obviously did that today. Any time youre playing against great players and theyre playing an innings like that, Im sure players on both sides will be watching and learning. He played a brilliant innings and (displayed) how he can go up and down the gears and absorb pressure, put a lot of pressure back on (the opponent), Buttler added in full admiration of Rohits blistering 119 off 90 balls. Rohit found his mojo right from the outset, taking on Englands new-ball attack of Saqib Mahmood and Gus Atkinson before dismantling the express pacer Mark Wood and spinner Adil Rashid to turn Indias 305-run chase into a one-sided contest. The England captain also lauded Rohits adaptability and said watching a player of his stature in action was a learning experience.  He really showed (that) in this day and age, in the modern sort of way of playing 50-over cricket, its very dynamic, very aggressive. He scored at a rate just confirms really that the way we want to play is the right way that you have to play to try and win games in cricket, Buttler said. The way Rohit played showed that the way we want to play our cricket is the way, the correct way to play cricket. Once again, England got off to a flier scoring 75 for no loss in the first 10 overs with Ben Duckett and Phil Salt making the most of the powerplay, before Indian spinners led by Ravindra Jadejas three-wicket haul seized the momentum. Buttler felt England fell short of a match-winning total. We, again, started really well. I thought Duckett and Salt played the powerplay brilliantly and got in some nice positions. We just needed one or two of us to sort of really kick on and play a real innings of note and maybe push our score up to 330-350 kind of territory, Buttler said. But some positives (are) there, weve been making steps again in the right direction, but probably didnt (put), not the perfect, complete performance with the bat. Credit to Rohit Sharma, I thought he played a fantastic knock. Hes set the standard in ODI cricket for a while and another great innings today, he added. Despite the defeat, Buttler counted on the positives in Englands approach and emphasised the importance of learning from such moments. Any time you dont win games in cricket, that tends to be what happens. You just werent quite good enough for long enough. In the cycle of the team, theres a few players who are just gaining experience and days like today are great lessons and thats what you want. Youve got to accelerate that learning and keep pushing the guys in the right direction. Like I say, were doing some things right. You always want to do some things better, he added. Buttler also acknowledged Joe Roots crucial contribution after the senior batter top scored with a 72-ball 69. Hes been someone we always rely on, can play that role to bat a lot of time. He doesnt face many dot balls, but hes always scoring at a good rate and hes a very consistent player. So, yeah, (he is a) really important guy in our team, Buttler signed off."
England’s Bethell ‘out of Champions Trophy’ says captain Buttler,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/england-champions-trophy-2025-jacob-bethell-injury-news-updates-jos-buttler-captain/article69201480.ece,"Jacob Bethell is set to miss next weeks Champions Trophy after the left-handed batsman sat out the second one-day international against India with a hamstring injury. The 21-year-old Bethell made 51 in the opening defeat last week, but was missing on Sunday as India took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series in Cuttack. The 50-over Champions Trophy begins on February 19 in Pakistan and Dubai. Im pretty sure (Bethell) has been ruled out of the Champions Trophy, to be honest, captain Jos Buttler admitted after Englands four-wicket defeat.  Thats really disappointing for him. Obviously, he played nicely the other day and has been one of the really exciting players, he added. Its a shame that injury is going to rule him out. England have not made an official statement on Bethells status, but they called up Somerset batsman Tom Banton on Sunday as cover. Wicketkeeper-batsman Banton, 26, was due to arrive in India on Monday and join the England squad for the final match of the series in Ahmedabad on Wednesday. Banton has played in six ODIs, with a top score of 58 and averages 26.80 with the bat. Englands first match in the Champions Trophy is against World Cup winners Australia on February 22.

Varuns ODI debut comes on the back of his strong outing in T20Is. Against England in the five-match T20 series, the Tamil Nadu tweaker scalped 14 wickets. The 33-year-old also had a solid Vijay Hazare Trophy 2024 campaign, where he took 18 wickets for Tamil Nadu at an incredible average of 12.16. From 23 List-A games, Varun has tallied 59 wickets at an average of 14.13, while giving away just 4.28 runs per over. Going into the England ODI series, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma had hinted that Varun was in contention for a last-minute spot in the Champions Trophy squad, while also praising his T20 performances. I understand that it was a T20 format, but he has clearly got something different about him. So we just wanted to have an option and see what we can do with him. Clearly during the series it presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage and see what he is capable of. Right now, we are not thinking about whether we are going to take him but definitely, he will be in contention. If things plan out well for us and he does what is required then definitely there is something that we need to think about, said Rohit. Varun replaced Kuldeep Yadav in Indias line-up for the second game. Kuldeep had returned with figures of one for 53 in the first ODI."
Warner backs Australia for Champions Trophy success despite injury problems,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/david-warner-backs-australia-to-win-champions-trophy-2025-title-despite-injury-problems-squad/article69196287.ece,"Former Australia opener David Warner has backed the one-day World Cup holder to do well in the Champions Trophy later this month despite losing several key players close to the tournament. Australia will need to make four changes to their preliminary squad for the eight-team tournament beginning on February 19 in Karachi, Pakistan. Regular captain Pat Cummins, fellow quick Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Mitch Marsh have been ruled out with injuries, while Marcus Stoinis withdrew himself after his shock decision to quit ODIs on Thursday. Australia are very good in the World Cups and Champions Trophies and in tournament play. So, the Australian team knows how to win. They know how to succeed. It doesnt matter what players they play, Warner told a virtual press conference. The guys are all built with playing under pressure. So, I think, whoever replaces those guys would do very well and the team in general would do great as well.  Australia has won the Champions Trophy twice, in 2006 and 2009, making it the most successful team in the tournament alongside India, which won in 2002 and 2013. Australia is presently engaged in a two-match test series in Sri Lanka, leading 1-0 following a comprehensive innings and 242-run victory in the opening test in Galle. Asked about Australias decision to drop Sam Konstas and promote Travis Head as Usman Khawajas opening partner, Warner deferred the question to the selectors. Theyve obviously wanted to get off to a good start and be positive. I think thats what they envisaged with Travis Head going up the order. But, I dont know. Youd have to ask them (selectors) why that happened, Warner said. Warner, who retired from Twenty20s after Australias 2024 T20 World Cup exit, is currently representing the Dubai Capitals in the International League T20 (ILT20) in the United Arab Emirates. Capitals will play the ILT20 final against Desert Vipers on Sunday."
Real task is not just winning Champions Trophy but also beating India: Pakistan PM Sharif,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-prime-minister-shehbaz-sharif-champions-trophy-2025-gaddafi-stadium-ceremony/article69195703.ece,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif says the real task for Pakistan is not just winning the ICC Champions Trophy but also defeating archrival India in Dubai on February 23. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the renovated and upgraded Gaddafi stadium on Friday night, Sharif said the players must give their best against India. We have a very good side and they have done well in recent times but the real task now is to not only win the Champions Trophy but also defeat our archrival India in the upcoming match in Dubai. The entire nation stands behind them, Sharif said. Pakistan and India have a history of cricket rivalry and generally the Indian team has held the advantage in ICC events since the 90s. Pakistans last win in an ICC event against India came in 2021 when they won in Dubai in the T20 World Cup. READ: Where will the Champions Trophy 2025 be held? Host, venues and schedule But with India refusing to send its team to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy and given the recent tense relations between the two cricket boards, the February 23 match has that extra edge to it. Pakistan will enter the tournament as defending champion. It was last held in 2017 in England with Pakistan winning the final. It is a big occasion for Pakistan that we are hosting a big ICC event after nearly 29 years, Sharif said. Sharif expressed excitement about the opportunity to host the Champions Trophy in Pakistan after 29 years. He is thrilled with the new-look stadium and the improved facilities, saying it reflects the spirit of Pakistans cricketing passion.

Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa will play a warm-up series ending on February 14 before the eight-team Champions Trophy starts five days later. We have the best choice of players so it is an important series and the best preparation for the bigger event, the Champions Trophy, Pakistan skipper Rizwan told reporters ahead of Saturdays match in Lahore. Defending champions Pakistan have suffered a poor record in all formats of cricket in recent years, but its performance has piqued somewhat recently. The team hopes to carry forward a winning momentum since Rizwan took the reins in November and won its first series in Australia in more than two decades by a 2-1 margin.  Pakistan has also beat Zimbabwe and inflicted the first-ever home whitewash on South Africa in December. Santner, who took over New Zealands white-ball captaincy last year, said the Champions Trophy would be at the back of the mind of his players on Saturday. Pakistan and New Zealand will also play the opening match of the Champions Trophy in Karachi, kicking off a tournament due to end on 9 March. I think its good prep for us as we are playing a game against Pakistan in similar conditions to probably what were going to face in Karachi, said Santner. The visiting skipper said his team have got good fast bowling stock raring to go including veteran pacers Tim Southee and Trent Boult as well as newcomers. Boult and Southee share 432 ODI wickets between them and last played ODIs for New Zealand in the 2023 World Cup held in India. The current team has Ben Sears, Will ORourke, Matt Henry and Nathan Smith with extra frontline pacer Lockie Ferguson recovering from injury and unlikely to play on Saturday. New Zealand will take on South Africa in the second match, also in Lahore, on Monday before the hosts play South Africa in Karachi on February 12 with a finale staged two days later."

However, as the team gears up for the three-match ODI series, beginning in Nagpur on Thursday, captain Jos Buttler has no intention of changing his teams aggressive brand of cricket. We want to find ways to put pressure on the opposition with the bat. Youve got to take wickets  its crucial. If you let batters settle, they can hurt you, so we will be desperate to find ways of taking wickets, Buttler said. Whatever plan you adopt, youve got to execute it well. We believe thats the best way to win games and maximise our players potential. So, well double down on that. I think we played well in phases in the T20s, but its really important we stay on course with how we want to play. The three-match series also presents an opportunity for the visiting team to address its weaknesses ahead of the Champions Trophy, scheduled to be held in Pakistan and the UAE from February 19. With England set to play all its league matches in Pakistan, lessons from this series against India could prove invaluable. The conditions in Pakistan may be similar. Each ground has its own nuances, and were always trying to adapt. As far as preparation for any tournament goes, taking on India in India is always a great challenge, Buttler said. Thats as good a preparation as you can have The England captain also emphasised that adapting to conditions is key to success in India. Whether you want to be aggressive, conservative, or measured, youve still got to go out there, execute, and play well, he said. If I look back at the [2023 ODI] World Cup, the two teams in the final (India and Australia) played a really positive and aggressive brand of cricket. Think of how Travis Head took charge in that final  it shows this approach can be successful. This is a great part of the world for that style of cricket. Rohit (Sharma) deserves a lot of credit for the way he has played as captain and pushed India towards that approach. We want to be exactly the same. We believe thats what gives us the best chance of getting positive results.  Buttler also confirmed that Joe Root remains Englands first-choice option for the No. 3 slot. Hes one of the greats of the game. He has been a vital part of Englands ODI cricket for a long time, and Im excited to see him in this phase of his career. Hes back with that cheeky smile, really enjoying his cricket, and I expect him to do exactly the same in this environment, he said. He has loads of experience in ODI cricket, which will be great for some of the guys who havent played as much in our group. Hes got a crucial role to play in these games"

Cummins has been troubled by an ankle injury that flared up after the test series win over India at the beginning of last month. The right-arm quick the missed the Test series in Sri Lanka due to the birth of his second child. Pat Cummins hasnt been able to resume any type of bowling so hes heavily unlikely, McDonald told Australian radio station SEN. In Cummins absence, McDonald projected Travis Head and Steve Smith as potential captaincy options for the Champions Trophy.  Theyre (Smith and Head) the two obvious ones. Steve has done a great job here in the (first) Test match (against Sri Lanka). Hes done some good work in one-day international cricket across the journey as well. So its between those two, said McDonald. McDonald also added that paceman Josh Hazlewood is also a doubt for the ODI tournament. Hazlewood missed three of the five India tests and the Sri Lanka tour with side and calf injuries. McDonald said he was battling to be fit and a decision would be made once medical information landed in coming days. All-rounder Mitchell Marsh has already been ruled out of the Champions Trophy with a back injury. The tournament starts on Feb. 19 and is being co-hosted by Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.."

Remembering his days when he donned the Kolkata Knight Riders colours and played under Gambhirs captaincy in the Indian Premier League, Suryakumar said, I have played under Gauti bhai for four years. I have spent a lot of time with him, I know how he works. Even he knows how to talk to each other. It started from the Sri Lanka series... We are moving in the right direction. He keeps it simple and gives a lot of freedom. He lets the players express themselves inside (the ground). He knows what goes on in the minds of the players, keeps the atmosphere light and relaxed in the dressing room.  Suryakumar said the Indian batting line-up would be flexible in the five-match T20I series against England, starting at the Eden Gardens here on Wednesday. We want to be very flexible with the batting order. Other than the openers, from three to seven or eight, everyone needs to be really flexible with their batting, said Suryakumar on the eve of the series opener. Anyone can go at any time. We have been practising for that. It will be changing with the matches. Suryakumar backed Sanju Samson for the wicketkeeper-batters job. Currently, there is no question mark on the wicketkeeper. Sanju has done really well in the last seven-eight or 10 matches he has played. He has really shown what he is capable of, said the India skipper."

Think about who else in the current squad could be considered for the vice-captain role. Im not saying whether the decision to make Shubman Gill vice-captain was right or wrong, but the point raised is valid, especially since he was the vice-captain in the last series as well, Ashwin said on his YouTube channel on Sunday. I could be mistaken, but I believe hes also had some vice-captaincy experience in Test cricket. This could be a forward-thinking move, as the management might be considering who could take on the leadership role in the future. While Gill has been appointed the ODI vice-captain, Axar Patel has been handed the role in T20Is. While both (Rishabh) Pant and (KL) Rahul could play together, theyve handed the vice-captaincy to the player whose spot in the XI is already secure. If Shubman Gill is groomed to lead in the future, he can rely on the guidance of senior players like Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah, Ashwin added. This squad mirrors the 2023 ODI World Cup, he said.

Kuldeep Yadav, who is yet to play following a long injury lay-off, also finds a place in the team and will be joined by Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, and Washington Sundar in the spin department.

Cummins recently confirmed he isnt travelling to Sri Lanka with the Test side later this month due to an ankle problem. Matt Short and Aaron Hardie got their maiden call-ups for an ICC event, while Nathan Ellis has also earned a spot. They are the three changes to the squad that won the 2023 ICC Mens Cricket World Cup in India, replacing David Warner (retired), Cameron Green (back surgery) and Sean Abbott. Ellis has been rewarded after his strong performance in the Big Bash League with Hobart Hurricanes, which has locked a finals berth in Australias domestic T20 tournament. All-rounders Matt Short and Aaron Hardie will offer versatility in Pakistan, while Ellis is an effective quick who can open and close with the white ball. Short has been a One Day International mainstay for the Aussies wince Warners retirement in November 2023, while Hardie has also represented Australia in 50-over cricket 11 times. It offers a variety of options for touring management depending on the opposition and the conditions that may present in Pakistan, said selection chair George Bailey. Australia, which last won the Champions Trophy in 2009, will open its campaign against arch-rival England in Lahore. There were question marks surrounding Pat Cummins availability.  His wife Becky is due to give birth to the pairs second child when Australias Test side tours Sri Lanka in late-January. On top of this, it was recently revealed he carried an ankle issue through his teams successful Border-Gavaskar Test series down under. Fellow quick Josh Hazlewood will also return to the fold, having been sidelined midway through Australias Test series with India due to a calf complaint. Like Cummins, Hazelwood is not travelling to Sri Lanka. This is a balanced and experienced squad with the core having been involved in the previous one-day World Cup, the West Indies series, last years successful tour of the UK and the more recent Pakistan home series, said Bailey. Australia will look to end a 15-year Champions Trophy drought, after going back-to-back in 2006 and 2009."

Bailey did not commit whether Cummins was a certainty for the Champions Trophy, starting on February 19. Not really sure yet, well have to wait and see where that scan comes back and where its tracking, he told nine.com.au. Australia announced its squad for the two-Test away series against Sri Lanka with several stalwarts, including Cummins, missing from the list. The team, made up mostly of fresh faces, will be captained by top-order batter Steve Smith.  Pats obviously on paternity leave for the next little bit, Bailey was quoted a saying on Thursday. Theres a little bit of work to do, hes got a little bit of a sore ankle as well so I think in the next week or so hes got a scan coming there and well get a bit more information around where thats at, he added. Bailey though expressed confidence that pacer Josh Hazlewood, who was ruled out of the pink-ball Test at Adelaide due to a left side injury and missed the last two games as well due to a calf strain, would be fit for the Champions Trophy. Hes working really hard, and all the news on how hes responding to the calf injury is coming along really well. On Hazlewood not featuring in the Sri Lanka-bound squad, Bailey said, It was just probably a little bit tight (for this squad) given the amount of time he wouldve missed and again looking how we potentially may structure up those loads those quicks may be put under. It just worked out that unfortunately for him he didnt quite get there in time (for Sri Lanka Tests) but really confident he should be fit and raring to go for the Champions Trophy, added Bailey."

The star all-rounder was not considered for either assignment after suffering a left hamstring injury during Englands defeat by New Zealand in the third Test at Hamilton earlier this month. Stokes did not bat in the second innings of that match in a bid to prevent further damage as England slumped to a colossal 423-run defeat -- a result that meant his side still won a three-match series 2-1. With England facing a five-match Test series at home to India starting in June before their pinnacle 2025/26 Ashes tour of Australia, team management have decided against risking inspirational red-ball skipper Stokes in the Champions Trophy. But key batsman Joe Root, who preceded close friend Stokes as Test captain, returns to the ODI side for the first time since the 2023 World Cup in India. Fast bowler Mark Wood, who missed the recent Test tours of both Pakistan and New Zealand, due to a bone-stress injury to his right elbow, is in both squads. The India series and Champions Trophy will mark Englands first limited-overs tour and tournament under coach Brendon McCullum, previously just in charge of the Test side. Buttler stays as captain Jos Buttler has retained the captaincy of the two white-ball teams despite England surrendering both their 50-over and T20 world titles since November 2023. But it is possible the dashing batsman may not keep wicket, as he has for much of his limited-overs career. Both the ODI squad for the India tour and the Champions Trophy, as well as the squad for five T20s in India in January, feature two other wicketkeepers in Test gloveman Jamie Smith, who missed the New Zealand series to attend the birth of his first child, and Phil Salt. Meanwhile, 21-year-old rising star Jacob Bethell, who marked his debut Test series with three fifties in New Zealand, is included in both squads. Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed joins the T20 squad, while Root is selected only for the ODIs. The tour party leaves for India on January 17, with the first match of a five-game series against T20 world champions India in Kolkata on January 22. India and England will then play a three-match ODI series, in preparation for the Champions Trophy, starting in Nagpur on February 6. Match dates for the Champions Trophy, which also features Pakistan as well as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, have yet to be announced, with the tournament due to run from February 19 to March 9.

ICC Champions Trophy 2025 to be held in hybrid model,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/champions-trophy-schedule-date-hybrid-model-neutral-venue-cricket-news-icc-announcement/article68927062.ece,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed on December 19 that the 2025 Champions Trophy will be staged using a hybrid model or at a neutral venue. Scheduled to take place in Pakistan, the tournament, set to begin on February 19, faced uncertainty due to Indias refusal to travel to the host nation. However, the ICC in a release has now said India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue. Political tensions between the two countries have prevented bilateral cricket outside major tournaments since 2008, with India last visiting Pakistan 16 years ago. However, Pakistan did travel to India for the 2023 ICC Mens Cricket World Cup. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi had previously opposed the hybrid hosting model, which would see Indias matches played in a different country. The eight-team Champions Trophy will feature Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, and South Africa, alongside hosts Pakistan."
"Pakistan should stop playing cricket with India, says Rashid Latif",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025-india-vs-pakistan-security-issues-news-rashid-latif/article68863244.ece,", Former wicket-keeper batter Rashid Latif says if had the power he would not let Pakistan play against India in any tournament and also suggested that ICC should not grant the hosting rights of global events to both countries until they resolve their issues. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has refused to send its team to Pakistan for the upcoming Champions Trophy, leading to speculations that the entire tournament could be moved out of the country. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) asking for written confirmation from the BCCI for Indias inability to travel to Pakistan for the tournament. Theres a big possibility that Pakistan can stop playing cricket against India. Had I been in power, then, yes, I may have taken this strong step. I would not blame anyone for this. If you dont want to play (in Pakistan), then dont play against us (at all), Latif, known for his plain speak, told PTI Videos. If I would have been there, I would have taken this decision, and fought against the BCCI. He suggested that the ICC should also stop giving major tournaments to both India and Pakistan till the issues are resolved. In my opinion, ICC should withhold the hosting rights for both countries until these issues between them are resolved; until their problems are settled, said the former wicketkeeper-batter, who played 37 Tests and 166 ODIs. Touching upon the issue of political interference in cricket, particularly in Asia, Latif referred to the ban imposed on Sri Lanka (in 2023) and Zimbabwe (in 2019) by the ICC and questioned why the global body was lenient towards India and Pakistan. READ | Pakistan looks for ICC explanation after India refuses to travel for Champions Trophy 2024 The ICC had suspended Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) in November last year for alleged political interference in the administration of the sport in the country. The suspension was lifted in January this year. Why arent India and Pakistan getting banned? Because, ICC has a lot of stake on them, he said. The former cricketer criticised BCCIs stance regarding security concerns for the Indian team in Pakistan, saying the ICCs security team had assessed his country and deemed it safe. This is the first time, I would say, the BCCI is at fault. The reason they are stating is very weak. It has to be in writing that the BCCI and the Indian cricket team is feeling threatened. The ICC security team came here and gave the green light for the tournament. If you had issues, you could have reported to them, he said. On whether Pakistan will withdraw from the Champions Trophy if the tournament is shifted elsewhere, the veteran said, Nobody has seen it on paper. It has to be written down on a piece of paper. We had a word with the PCB (and) they said they have sent an e-mail to the Pakistan government regarding this. This is a serious legal issue, nobody is willing to give it in writing. Latif was confident that lack of matches with India would not hamper Pakistan crickets progress. We didnt play at home for 12 long years. What could be more painful than that? Pakistan will get the 34 million dollars in every eight-year cycle (from ICC), whether they play India or not. The boards that are rich will suffer losses, not a board like PCB that doesnt have the money. Pakistan can survive playing bilateral series even if they dont play major ICC tournaments."
Shubman Gill overtakes Babar Azam to become No. 1 batter; Ravindra Jadeja & Mohammad Shami drop down ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-shubman-gill-overtakes-babar-azam-become-no-1-batter-ravindra-jadeja-mohammad-shami-drop-ahead-2025-champions-trophy,"Team India's star batter Shubman Gill has overtaken Pakistan's Babar Azam to become the new No.1 batter in the latest ICC Men's Player ODI Rankings ahead of the 2025 Champions Trophy. Gill is at the top with 796 rating points, while the Pakistan batter has dropped a spot down to second place with 773 rating points. This is not the first time that Shubman Gill has made it to the top spot in the ODI batting rankings. Half-way through the 2023 ODI World Cup, Gill had overtaken Babar to take the top spot. The young opener has been in great form heading into the 2025 Champions Trophy. Gill was the top run-scorer with 259 runs from three matches in the home ODI series against England at an average of 86.33 with a strike rate of 103.60, including a hundred and two half-centuries. As a result of this stellar performance, the Indian batter has risen to the top of the ODI batting rankings. While Shubman Gill has risen to the top of the ODI batting rankings, his Indian teammates all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and pacer Mohammad Shami have dropped down in the rankings ahead of the 2025 Champions Trophy. In the ICC Men's ODI Rankings for bowlers, Jadeja dropped two spots from 11th to 13th position with 612 rating points. It comes as a slight surprise as Jadeja picked up six wickets from two matches in the recent ODI series against England at home. The left-arm spinner was the joint second-highest wicket-taker in the series. Meanwhile, pacer Mohammed Shami also dropped two places, going down to the 15th position from 13th with 591 rating points. Shami returned to International cricket after being away due to injury in the home series against England. He played two ODIs and managed to pick up just two wickets. Shami did not look at his complete best despite his return. However, both Shami and Jadeja will have a vital role to play in the 2025 Champions Trophy as senior members of the Indian team."
“Pakistan team is under much more pressure” - R Ashwin’s huge statement ahead of IND vs PAK 2025 Champions Trophy match,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-pakistan-team-much-pressure-r-ashwin-s-huge-statement-ahead-ind-vs-pak-2025-champions-trophy-match,"Former India cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin has claimed that Pakistan are visibly under tremendous pressure in Indo-Pak contests. His comments came ahead of the high-octane ICC Champions Trophy 2025 clash, scheduled on Sunday, February 23, in Dubai. The 38-year-old remarked that the Men in Blue are calm and composed compared to their arch-rivals. The legendary spinner, however, warned that the Men in Green can outperform India on their day. Ashwin's comments are synonymous with the results. In their last 10 ODI meetings, India have beaten Pakistan seven times including one draw. Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash ki Baat (via Indian Express): For the unversed, Ashwin led India to a victory against Pakistan in a last-ball thriller in the 2022 T20 World Cup. The right-hander famously let go of a wide (down the leg side) when India needed two runs off the ultimate delivery. The Tamil Nadu all-rounder also backed the Rohit Sharma-led side to win back-to-back ICC titles but expressed concern about five spinners in the squad. Ashwin said: The Men in Blue have made rapid strides in their last 18 months, reaching the 2023 ODI World Cup final and lifting the 2024 T20 World Cup. R Ashwin further pointed out the relevance of the toss factor in Dubai while picking Rohit Sharma and company as the favorite to reach the final. He picked New Zealand, South Africa, and Afghanistan among the other three nations that might reach the last four. Indias squad for ICC Champions Trophy, 2025: Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, and Varun Chakaravarthy. At present, whenever India and Pakistan play against each other, the Indian team is not under that much pressure as compared to what Pakistan team experiences. The Indian team is much more relaxed when there is a match against Pakistan at present. The Pakistan team is under much more pressure and it is visible as one sees their players. It seems that they are playing under a lot of pressure. Its a bit sad but I think this Pakistan team has the quality and they can do something. If its their day, they can outperform India, he added. This Indian team is a champion material team. I only have my reservations about five spinners in the squad. This is the team that has got the meat to be champions and there is a chance to win an ICC tournament for the second consecutive time. Its an early call. But I feel that if India wins the toss twice in Dubai, then India or New Zealand playing in the final is the highest. This is an early call but I think India will be in the final. My four qualifying teams will be India, New Zealand, New Zealand, and South Africa. Afghanistan has got an outside chance. Champions Trophy has always seen surprises."
"“Wearing a tie & talking in English, you think you have become civilized”- Ex-Pakistan bowler’s brutal attack on India ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-wearing-tie-talking-english-think-become-civilized-ex-pakistan-bowler-s-brutal-attack-india-ahead-2025-champions-trophy,"Former Pakistan spinner Saqlain Mushtaq has slammed Team India for their refusal to travel to Pakistan for the 2025 Champions Trophy, starting today, February 19. He also made scathing remarks on India's overall attitude and urged Pakistan to teach them a lesson. In the months leading up to the Champions Trophy, there was plenty of back and forth between the two countries and their respective boards regarding India's travel to Pakistan for the mega event. Eventually, it was agreed upon that the Men in Blue would play their 2025 Champions Trophy matches in Dubai, while the rest of the tournament will be played in Pakistan. Speaking on a local TV channel, Saqlain lambasted India ahead of the marquee tournament, saying [via Crictoday]: The two teams will clash in a much-anticipated encounter of Group A in Dubai on Sunday, February 23. Pakistan are the defending champions, having defeated India in the final of the 2017 edition by 180 runs. Saqlain Mushtaq opened up about his torrid personal experience while touring India to work with the New Zealand side recently. The Black Caps played India in a three-Test away series, stunning the hosts with a 3-0 series victory. He continued: Saqlain's scathing attack on India adds fuel to the fire in the build-up to the highly-anticipated India-Pakistan encounter on Sunday. The two teams last met in the 2024 T20 World Cup, with India pulling off a thrilling six-run victory. Their tantrums are not getting over. We are still praising them. The youngsters in Pakistan want to see Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah. I dont know in which world they are living in and what they want to achieve. When are they going to be intelligent and wise? When they will open their hearts? By wearing a tie and taking in English, you think you have become civilized. Pakistan should take a stand and teach them a lesson."" ""I will tell you my own personal experience. Ahead of the India-New Zealand series that happened recently (November 2024), where New Zealand whiteashed them 3-0, maar ke aaye inko (thrashed them), I was New Zealand's spin (bowling) consultant before being appointed as mentor by the PCB,"" Saqlain told a local TV channel (via TOI). ""Five months before (the tour), I received a letter from the Indian cricket board as well from the New Zealand cricket board for (Indian) visa. I booked (an appointment) online from Leicester (England) where I have my home and got an appointment for two weeks later. They made me sit in queue for 4 hours."" ""I felt a bit embarrassed and I was disappointed as well for the treatment being meted out to me. They said you have to be in line...You won't believe how many people I approached (to get my visa processed). The status remained the same for three months. In the meantime, I got this offer from PCB. So I refused the visa, they took fee as well and did not even acknowledge. It ended there,"" he concluded."
“He’s going to make big runs” - Former Australia captain suggests new batting role for Steve Smith at 2025 Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-he-s-going-make-big-runs-former-australia-captain-suggests-new-batting-role-steve-smith-2025-champions-trophy,"Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting feels that the team management should consider promoting Steve Smith as an opener in the Champions Trophy 2025 amid the form and injury crisis. While Travis Head is set to hold one of the two spots, his partners like Jake Fraser-McGurk and Matt Short have been far from convincing. Australia, who are battling a major conundrum with their inexperienced makeshift bowling attack, are also plagued with issues in their batting department. The middle-order comprising Josh Inglis, Alex Carey, and Glenn Maxwell holds relatively well together despite Marnus Labuschagne's poor run of form. But, the Men in Yellow need a definite solution at the top, considering the importance of the role. They had a reasonably experienced candidate in the form of Mitchell Marsh, but the all-rounder has been ruled out of the tournament due to an injury. Ponting recommends an unconventional solution, where Smith partners Head at the top, and plays as the anchor that holds the innings together. Steve Smith has never opened the batting in ODI cricket before. He has played at the top of the order in T20 cricket in recent times, heavily for the Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League, and sporadically for the national team. He had a brief stint as a Test opener in 2024 after David Warner's retirement too, but the plug was pulled ahead of the Border-Gavaskar series later in the same year. The need for an alternate option in the opening department stems from Jake Fraser McGurk and Matt Short's lack of runs of late. The pair opened the innings in the three-match ODI series against Pakistan at home, where they averaged just 20 for the first wicket. Even in the recently concluded ODI series against Sri Lanka, they were not among the runs. Fraser-McGurk and Short scored 11 and 2 runs respectively in the two-match series. The transition from David Warner to Jake Fraser-McGurk in white-ball cricket was expected to be smooth after the former retired from international cricket after the 2024 T20 World Cup. However, the emerging player has not made the most of his opportunity. He has copped blame from former players consistently for his poor shot selection, and inability to make the most of a start. In the seven ODIs he has played since his debut in early 2024, only 98 runs at an average of 14 have been scored. Furthermore, he faces competition from Matt Short, who brings his ability as a part-time off-spinner to the table. Ponting has worked closely with Jake Fraser-McGurk during the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season when the youngster came in as an injury replacement for the Delhi Capitals (DC) Do they think about opening the batting with Steve Smith, which is something that they could actually think about as well, I think, because of how well he's done in white ball cricket when he has opened the batting,"" Ponting said on the ICC Review. (Smith) could be someone that could be an anchor through this Champions Trophy at the top of the order. And you know that with the form that he's in, he's going to make big runs,"" he added . Yeah, he's making it harder and harder (for selectors to stick with Fraser-McGurk). He's not had the greatest of summers. I mean, there's just so much talent there. There's so much ability and skill and talent that we haven't sort of seen consistently enough just yet. And that's one of the big calls (selectors) are going to have to make now as well,"" Ponting said"
Pakistan make amends days after Indian flag controversy at 2025 Champions Trophy [In Picture],https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-pakistan-make-amends-days-indian-flag-controversy-2025-champions-trophy-in-picture,"As the 2025 Champions Trophy is all set to begin today (February 19), the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have made amends following a recent controversy about the absence of the Indian flag at the National Stadium in Karachi. A video had gone viral on social media in which India's flag was missing at the National Stadium a few days ago. While the flags of all other teams were there, it was speculated that the India flag was left out as the Men In Blue had refused to travel to Pakistan and would play their matches in Dubai. However, the host nation has now made amends days after the controversy. The latest visuals from the National Stadium in Karachi show the Indian flag placed alongside the flags of other participating teams. Flags of all eight nations taking part in the Champions Trophy 2025 are now present at the venue. The PCB also gave a clarification on the controversy, saying that only flags of teams that are playing the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan were raised at the stadiums. Apart from India, even the Bangladesh flag was missing in Karachi and Lahore. A clarification was issued on the same as well. The PCB said since Bangladesh had not arrived in Pakistan and will play their first match against India in Dubai on February 20, their flag was not put up. The flags of the teams that have arrived in Pakistan have been hoisted and are present at the venue. India and Bangladesh will face each other in their 2025 Champions Trophy opening clash in Dubai on Thursday, February 20. ""As you know, India is not coming to Pakistan to play its matches during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025; the National Stadium in Karachi, Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, and the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore have hoisted flags of countries that are going to play at the said venues,"" a PCB source was quoted as saying by IANS (via NDTV Sports). ""The Indian team is going to play its matches in Dubai. Secondly, the Bangladesh team has not yet arrived in Pakistan and will be playing its first match against India in Dubai. Therefore, their flags have not been hoisted and the other nations, who have arrived here and will be playing in Pakistan... their flags are there at the stadium,"" the source added in the same interview."
"PAK vs NZ Dream11 Prediction: 3 Differentials you can pick for today's Champions Trophy 2025 match - February 19, 2025",https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/pak-vs-nz-dream11-prediction-3-differentials-can-pick-today-s-champions-trophy-2025-match-february-19-2025,"Pakistan (PAK) and New Zealand (NZ) face off in the curtain-raiser of the Champions Trophy 2025 (CT 2025) on Wednesday, February 19, at the National Stadium in Karachi. With even one defeat potentially costing a team a chance at making the semi-finals, both teams will be keen on registering a win in this fixture. NZ and PAK met less than five days ago in the Final of the Tri-Series with South Africa at the same venue, with New Zealand romping home to an easy victory. However, Pakistan are the defending champions of the Champions Trophy and that will give them some confidence leading up to this match. Both sides are well-balanced and well-suited for ODI cricket, and it'd be a surprise if this game is anything but an engrossing watch. On that note, let's look at three players who could make excellent Dream11 differentials. It's a straight toss-up between Saud Shakeel and Kamran Ghulam for the No.3 spot in Pakistan's playing XI today. With both players not in the best of form, the seniority and experience of the former might see him favored, and if that does happen, Shakeel could be a very handy Dream11 differential. Shakeel might not have the best ODI record, but he is very familiar with the National Stadium in Karachi, having played in 10 Test matches at this venue, averaging 51.8 with the bat. While his form is a concern, his batting position more than makes up for it. All it takes is one good inning for a player to get back into his groove, and considering his very high points ceiling, it's worth taking a risk and backing Saud Shakeel in this fixture. One of the most highly-rated players in this current New Zealand team, right-arm pacer William O'Rourke could be a solid differential pick on Dream11 for this match. While the start to O'Rourke's ODI career has been a tad expensive, 14 wickets in nine outings at a bowling average of 29.57 aren't bad numbers at all. In his most recent game only four days ago at the National Stadium, O'Rourke broke the back of the Pakistan batting order, finishing with terrific figures of 4/43 in 9.3 overs. Considering that his role in this Black Caps bowling unit sees him take the new ball and operate at the death, O'Rourke has the chance to pick up lots of wickets and bowl quite a few dot balls. That makes him a very potent Dream11 differential going into this fixture. New Zealand's dependable and perennial backup top order batter Will Young could have an extended role to play in CT 2025, with Rachin Ravindra still recovering from an injury. In 40 ODIs, Young has scored more than 1500 runs at an average of 43.08 and is a class act in this format. However, his form in the Tri-Series wasn't up to the mark and as a result, his Dream11 ownership is quite low coming into this match. However, excluding this series, Young has enjoyed batting against Pakistan, scoring 240 runs in five matches in NZ's 2023 tour of Pakistan. The underlying numbers for Young may not as be as high as the others, but an opening batter with minimal Dream11 ownership is a rare sight. For those willing to take a punt, Will Young could be a rewarding differential pick."
How have Team India fared in the opening matches of the Champions Trophy?,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/how-team-india-fared-opening-matches-champions-trophy,"The 2025 Champions Trophy is set to kick off in just a few hours, with hosts Pakistan taking on New Zealand in the opening match on Wednesday, February 19, at the National Stadium in Karachi. Meanwhile, the Indian team will step onto the field on Thursday, February 20, to face Bangladesh in their opening game at the Dubai International Stadium. Following that, India will meet their arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday, February 23, with their final group-stage match scheduled against New Zealand on March 2. All of Indias matches in the tournament will be played in Dubai. In the 2017 edition, India lost to Pakistan in the final. This time, they will be determined to go one step further and secure the title. As India gear up for their first match against Bangladesh, this article looks at how they have performed in the tournaments opening matches over the years. India's opening match in the inaugural ICC Champions Trophy (then known as the Wills International Cup) in 1998 was against Australia. The quarter-final took place at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka, where Australia won the toss and opted to field. Batting first, India posted a total of 307/8 in their 50 overs, thanks to a brilliant century from Sachin Tendulkar (141 off 128 balls) and a fifty from Ajay Jadeja (71 off 65). In response, Mark Waugh was the top scorer for Australia with 74 runs. Tendulkar also starred with the ball, taking four wickets, as India won by 44 runs, with Australia being bowled out for 263. In the 2000 Champions Trophy (ICC KnockOut), India played Kenya in their opening match, a pre-quarterfinal, at the Gymkhana Club Ground in Nairobi. Asked to bat first, Kenya posted a total of 208/9 in their 50 overs, with Ravi Shah (60) and captain Maurice Odumbe (51) contributing fifties. Zaheer Khan was the standout bowler for India, taking three wickets. In reply, India comfortably chased down the target, thanks to half-centuries from captain Sourav Ganguly (66) and Rahul Dravid (68*), securing an impressive eight-wicket victory with 45 balls to spare. In the 2002 Champions Trophy, India faced Zimbabwe in their opening match at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Opting to bat first, India posted a total of 288/6 in their 50 overs, with Mohammad Kaif shining with an unbeaten 111 off 112 balls and Rahul Dravid contributing 71 runs. In response, Andy Flower played a stellar knock for Zimbabwe, scoring 145 off 164 balls. However, his efforts werent enough as Zimbabwe finished their 50 overs at 274/8, falling short by 14 runs. Zaheer Khan was the standout bowler for India, taking four wickets. India faced Kenya in their opening match of the 2004 Champions Trophy, held at The Rose Bowl in Southampton. Kenya won the toss and chose to bowl first. Half-centuries from skipper Sourav Ganguly (90 off 124 balls) and VVS Laxman (79 off 99 balls) helped India set a total of 290/4 in their 50 overs. In reply, Kenya never seemed to threaten the target and ended up falling short by 98 runs, finishing their 50 overs at 192/7. Harbhajan Singh was the pick of the bowlers for India, taking three wickets. Hosts India faced England in their opening match of the 2006 Champions Trophy at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. Asked to bat first, England had a disappointing performance, being bowled out for just 125 runs. Munaf Patel and Ramesh Powar were the stars with the ball, each taking three wickets for India. In reply, Virender Sehwag contributed 35 runs, while Yuvraj Singh remained unbeaten on 27, as India chased down the target to win by four wickets and start their campaign with a victory. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in their opening match of the 2009 Champions Trophy at SuperSport Park in Centurion. Pakistan won the toss and chose to bat. Shoaib Malik played a brilliant knock, scoring 128 off 126 balls, while Mohammad Yousuf contributed 87 runs, helping Pakistan reach 302/9 in their 50 overs. Ashish Nehra was the standout bowler for India, taking four wickets. In response, Gautam Gambhir made 57 runs, and Rahul Dravid contributed 76 runs. Later in the innings, Suresh Raina added 46 runs, but India were eventually bowled out for 248, falling short by 54 runs. South Africa and India faced off in the opening match of the 2013 Champions Trophy at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. Asked to bat first, India posted a total of 331/7 in their 50 overs, with Shikhar Dhawan scoring 114 off 94 balls and Rohit Sharma contributing 65 runs. In response, three South African batters made half-centuries: Robin Peterson (68), AB de Villiers (70), and Ryan McLaren (71*). However, it wasn't enough, as South Africa were bowled out for 305 on the final delivery of their innings, falling short by 26 runs. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in their opening match of the 2017 Champions Trophy at Edgbaston, Birmingham. After being asked to bat first, India's opening duo of Shikhar Dhawan (68) and Rohit Sharma (91) provided a strong start. Later, captain Virat Kohli (81) and Yuvraj Singh (53) took control, guiding India to 319/3 in their 50 overs. In response, Pakistan never looked in contention and were bowled out for 164, falling short by 124 runs while chasing a revised target of 289 runs under the DLS method. Umesh Yadav was the standout performer for India, claiming three wickets."
India or Australia - Which team is the favorite to win 2025 Champions Trophy?,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/india-australia-which-team-favorite-win-2025-champions-trophy,"Another ICC tournament and yet again, India and Australia stand out from the rest to be considered favorites. In the modern era, the two powerhouses always find a way to be among the cream of the crop, whether it is men's cricket, women's cricket, or even at the youth level, irrespective of the circumstances and the situation. That is the kind of aura they carry. Slotted into different groups, India and Australia have to overcome different sorts of challenges to make it to the knockout stage. In Group A, the Men in Blue have an in-form New Zealand and arch-rivals Pakistan as their biggest obstacles. Australia's Group B members England and South Africa are battling poor form, but fortunes can quickly turn in an ecosystem of a tournament. Unpredictable elements like Bangladesh and Afghanistan are also present to hamper the heavyweights' path towards the title. The last time ICC held a 50-over event, it all boiled down to India and Australia in the final as the Men in Yellow walked away with the 2023 World Cup. With the ODI format making a return at the biggest stage, there could be a chance that they face off yet again for the coveted trophy. The common plaguing theme for India and Australia in the build-up to the Champions Trophy has been the bowling unit. The Men in Yellow will be without their pace-trio of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood. India, on the other hand, will miss Jaspit Bumrah's services for the ICC event. Australia have compiled a bowling attack from scratch, while India have made some bold calls by including an undercooked Mohammed Shami and a rookie pacer in Harshit Rana. However, both sides have relief from their spin bowling unit and the reliable batting department. While the woes of both sides are of the same nature, it cannot be disputed that Australia have their woes compounded. Uncertainty in the top order and a lack of balance, along with the absence of Marcus Stoinis and Mitchell Marsh, are a couple of additional issues that India do not have to concern themselves with. India had to fulfill game time and work out their combinations all in the space of three ODIs against England, and to their credit, they did a relatively good job. The series allowed India to get a clear idea regarding their first-choice playing XI and helped several players return to form and find the rhythm. The Men in Blue thrashed England 3-0 in the ODI series to get some valuable momentum under their belt. Almost all batters were among the runs while the bowlers also got into the act to mark their presence. Australia had a similar opportunity in the form of a two-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, who are not even participating in the Champions Trophy. The Men in Yellow's playing XI, largely constituting makeshift members, were handed a rude awakening call in the form of a series whitewash. The batters struggled against spin, which is a concern even though they will be handed mostly flat decks in Pakistan. The inexperienced bowling unit had their moments, especially with the new ball, but failed to produce sustained pressure. Zampa's poor returns in spin-friendly conditions were also surprising, which is a notable aspect since Australia's hopes hinge on the leg-spinner's returns in the middle overs. There is a reason why Australia are considered one of the favorites despite their crippling crisis, and that is their ability to turn up when it matters. Luckily that trait has not been confined to just the high-profile players but is deeply embedded in the Australian DNA and their way of functioning. Many paid the price for underestimating the team after they lost their opening set of matches in the 2023 ODI World Cup. However, never have Australia faced a crisis of this magnitude. Despite all of their aura and mentality, as many as five first-team members being ruled out at the last minute will have an effect on the team in some way or the other. Luckily, amid all of the misfortune, Australia are blessed to have an experienced leader like Steve Smith to navigate this situation. His captaincy will be the key that Australia need to negate all of the absences and lack of form. India, on the other hand, showcased exactly why they should be considered as favorites in the series against England. Although they did have their wobbly moments, they overcame them with ease, a true mark of a champion side. They come into the Champions Trophy with nearly all boxes ticked, as opposed to Australia. In the end, Australia are vulnerable across two fronts. They are vulnerable to self-imploding and at risk of being outplayed. However, with India, there is a slim chance of being outplayed by the opposition, given their prowess, depth, and form, which makes them the clear favorite to win the trophy."
“I would have given India a 90 had Bumrah been there” - R Ashwin reviews India’s chances at 2025 Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-i-given-india-90-bumrah-there-r-ashwin-reviews-india-s-chances-2025-champions-trophy,"Former India cricketer R Ashwin shared his observations for the Men In Blue ahead of their 2025 Champions Trophy opening clash. Rohit Sharma and his troops are set to begin their campaign against Bangladesh on Thursday, February 20, in Dubai. Talking in a video on his YouTube channel, Ashwin reviewed India's chances at the 2025 Champions Trophy. The all-rounder reflected that he would have given the Men In Blue a rating of 90 points had Jasprit Bumrah not been ruled out, adding that they are a totally different side with him present. Ashwin also expressed his concern for the Indian team, stating that since they are playing all their 2025 Champions Trophy group-stage games in Dubai, the toss will be a crucial factor. Harshit Rana, who made his ODI debut in the recently concluded home series against England, replaced Bumrah in the squad for the marquee ICC event. Mohammed Shami and Arshdeep Singh are the other two frontline pacers in the squad. Ashwin also rated the other three teams in India's group for the 2025 Champions Trophy. India are placed in Group A alongside hosts Pakistan, Bangladesh, and New Zealand. The former Indian all-rounder gave New Zealand a rating of 85 as well. The Kiwis recently participated in the tri-nation series in Pakistan and won the tournament being unbeaten with most of their batters displaying solid form. However, he did not rate the other two teams in India's group highly. As for hosts Pakistan, Ashwin gave them a rating of just 55. For Bangladesh, it was even lower as he rated them only 40 ahead of the start of the tournament. ""I'll give them 85. I would given India a 90 had Bumrah been there because India is completely different with him in the mix. The only concern for India in my view is that all their games are in Dubai. Let's say we lose all three tosses and are put into bat first because it's chalk and cheese between day and night at this venue. So if opponents bat under lights, this 85 might start dropping,"" he said."
"PAK vs NZ Dream11 Prediction: 3 players you can pick as captain or vice-captain for today’s Champions Trophy 2025 match – February 19, 2025",https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/pak-vs-nz-dream11-prediction-3-players-can-pick-captain-vice-captain-today-s-champions-trophy-2025-match-february-19-2025,"The hosts Pakistan (PAK) go up against New Zealand (NZ) in the first match of the Champions Trophy 2025 on Wednesday, February 19, at the National Stadium in Karachi. This is the first edition of the Champions Trophy since 2017. Pakistan are the defending champions, beating India in the final in 2017. They'll look to begin their title defense with a win in front of their home fans. However, Mitchell Santner and company will be confident of their chances against the hosts, especially after beating them twice in the space of a week in the recently concluded ODI Tri-Series (involving South Africa) that they won. This contest between two solid ODI outfits is bound to be a good one. Let's now look at three players who would make great Dream11 captaincy options. Some selection calls that Pakistan have made in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy have been questioned by pundits, but recalling Fakhar Zaman to open the batting isn't one of them. A swashbuckling player who excels in the ODI format, Fakhar Zaman has the potential to register some massive Dream11 hauls in this tournament. The 34-year-old has scored 3627 ODI runs at an average of 46.50. Those numbers further improve against New Zealand. Zaman loves playing the Black Caps and has scored more runs against them than any other opposition (1053), averaging 65.81. An attacking opener with a penchant for finding the boundary with ease, Fakhar Zaman is a top Dream11 captaincy option. One of Pakistan's most in-form batters coming into the Champions Trophy 2025, off-spinning all-rounder Agha Salman could be a great choice for Dream11 captaincy. Just two innings ago, he played a blinder of a knock (103-ball 134) against South Africa to take Pakistan to the final of their tri-Series, where they lost to New Zealand. Salman loves batting at the National Stadium, averaging 58.3 and scoring at a strike rate of 108.8. He's also picked up four wickets with the ball, and his off-spin could be crucial in containing the likes of Devon Conway, Michael Bracewell, and Mitchell Santner. A consistent all-rounder who loves finding the boundary, making Agha Salman the captain or vice-captain is pretty much a no-brainer. In terms of sheer dependability as an option, no one can beat Kane Williamson as a Dream11 captaincy pick. The rock of the Black Caps' batting unit, Williamson is a minimum guarantee pick on Dream11 in ODI and Test matches, especially on surfaces like the ones we're going to see in Pakistan. The former New Zealand skipper was the second-highest run-scorer of the recently concluded tri-series, where he made 225 runs at an average of 112.50. Williamson loves batting in Pakistan, making 389 runs in six innings at a stellar average of 77.8. Irrespective of whether the Kiwis bat or bowl first, Kane Williamson will rightfully be one of the most captained players going into this Champions Trophy fixture."

The host nation has ensured tight security and other special arrangements for the ICC event. According to a report in The News (Pakistan Media, via Hindustan Times), the Punjab Police have deployed over 12,000 police officers and personnel for matches in Lahore and Rawalpindi. The breakdown of this number includes 18 senior officers, 54 DSPs, 135 inspectors, 1200 upper subordinates, 10556 constables, and over 200 female police officers. Further, Lahore will have over 8,000 officers and personnel. Lahore is set to host three 2025 Champions Trophy matches between February 22 and March 5. The breakdown includes 12 senior officers, 39 DSPs, 86 inspectors, 700 upper subordinates, 6673 constables, and 129 female constables. Rawalpindi will also host three games and the city is expected to have more than 5000 officers who will be assigned duty. Karachi is the third venue for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Additionally, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has announced the deployment of nine special charter flights. These flights will be operational for both fans and participating teams and will run between Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore to ensure hassle-free transportation. Pakistan last hosted an ICC event in 1996  the ODI World Cup. They were set to host the Champions Trophy in 2009. However, following the attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore that year, the tournament was shifted out of Pakistan and was played in South Africa. After the incident, the nation lost the right to host any ICC event. Not until recently, did international cricket take place in the country, as Pakistan played their games in the UAE. Therefore, after a long gap of nearly three decades, an ICC event has returned to Pakistan in the form of the 2025 Champions Trophy. Hence, the host nation has made tight security arrangements along with other special arrangements to ensure smooth conduct of the tournament."
"""This team has just 1 proper spinner"" - Aakash Chopra on Pakistan's issue ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy clash vs New Zealand",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-this-team-just-1-proper-spinner-aakash-chopra-pakistan-s-issue-ahead-2025-champions-trophy-clash-vs-new-zealand,"Former India player Aakash Chopra has noted that he would keenly watch Khushdil Shah's performance with the ball in the 2025 Champions Trophy as Pakistan have only Abrar Ahmed as a specialist spinner in their squad. He also opined that Babar Azam needs to be among the runs for the Men in Green to harbor hopes of qualifying for the semi-finals. Pakistan will face New Zealand in the 2025 Champions Trophy opener in Karachi on Wednesday, February 19. They will subsequently play India in Dubai on February 23 and Bangladesh in Rawalpindi four days later in their other two Group A games. In a video shared on his YouTube channel 'Aakash Chopra', the former India opener opined that Babar could hold the key to Pakistan's prospects in the ICC event. Chopra also expressed eagerness to see how Tayyab Tahir and Khushdil Shah perform for the hosts, saying (7:25): Aakash Chopra pointed out that Pakistan could consider playing Faheem Ashraf to have an additional bowling option. He added that there might be a toss-up between Ashraf and Tahir in such a scenario. In the same video, Aakash Chopra highlighted the significance of Pakistan's 2025 Champions Trophy clash against New Zealand. The cricketer-turned-commentator noted that India and New Zealand can make Pakistan's match against Bangladesh inconsequential if they win their respective first two games. Aakash Chopra opined that New Zealand might be the favorites heading into their 2025 Champions Trophy clash against Pakistan. However, he reckoned that Mohammad Rizwan and company might somehow win Wednesday's game. ""If this team has to progress in this tournament, Babar needs to score runs from two points of view. Firstly, he is such a big player, and if he doesn't score runs, how will the team get confidence? Point two, which is an equally important point, he is an opener. If you lose your opener early, you need to do the rebuilding job."" ""So Babar's form is absolutely critical for their existence. Fakhar Zaman will be there with him and Saud Shakeel will come at No. 3. I am very curious to see how Tayyab Tahir plays and how much Khushdil Shah's bowling works because this team has just one proper spinner. The others pitch in, whether it's Salman Agha or Khushdil Shah,"" Chopra added. ""The team is looking good but a team is as good as it is on the ground. This is your potential banana skin because if you lose this match and then the next one against India, you will be out of the tournament. The hosts will be out as one win won't be enough,"" he said (8:45). ""If India beat Bangladesh tomorrow and then beat you, India will have two wins. New Zealand would have also won two after some time, and then both of us would play to decide the No. 1 and No. 2 in the group, and Pakistan and Bangladesh would be out,"" Chopra observed."
“We have discussed mistakes we have made” - Babar Azam makes strong statement ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-we-discussed-mistakes-made-babar-azam-makes-strong-statement-ahead-2025-champions-trophy,"Pakistan's ace batter Babar Azam has claimed that he is calm and collected as they prepare to defend their Champions Trophy title this year. The former captain said their past is behind them and Pakistan have made a conscious effort to rectify their mistakes. Having sealed their first Champions Trophy title in 2017, the Men in Green could be under pressure to defend their crown, especially in front of the home crowd. This will also be the first ICC event hosted by Pakistan in 29 years (1996 World Cup). Ahead of the tournament opener against New Zealand on Wednesday in Karachi, the Lahore-born cricketer said he looks at the responsibility of being a senior player positively. Babar Azam said (as quoted by the ICC): The 30-year-old's form is a massive talking point for the defending champions. He yielded scores of 10, 23, and 29 in the preceding tri-series against New Zealand and South Africa. The right-hander has an outstanding record at No. 3 but skipper Mohammad Rizwan asserted that Babar will open the innings in Saim Ayub's absence (ankle injury). Babar acknowledged that Pakistan have had plenty of new players since the previous Champions Trophy edition in 2017 but their belief and optimism haven't changed. In the same interview, he said: Pakistan's high-voltage clash against India is on Sunday, February 23, in Dubai. ""There is no pressure of anything. What has happened in the past is beyond us. We have discussed mistakes we have made and we have worked on them. When you have responsibility as a senior player in any team and the team relies on you and has belief in you, then I take it in a positive way."" ""As a player, I am very excited, and all the fans are excited. A lot has changed since the Champions Trophy was held in 2017. We have new players coming, we only have three or four players who were part of that winning team. But the belief, confidence and execution are the same."""
“Does he play for India” - 2017 winner blasts Pakistan for favoritism to injured player ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-does-play-india-2017-winner-blasts-pakistan-favoritism-injured-player-ahead-2025-champions-trophy,"Pakistan pacer Hasan Ali has accused the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) of favoritism towards the young injured opener, Saim Ayub, ahead of the 2025 Champions Trophy. Ali, who helped Pakistan win the 2017 Champions Trophy, is currently out of favor with the national selectors. Meanwhile, Ayub was in the middle of a sensational tour of South Africa earlier this year when he suffered an ankle injury during the second and final Test in Cape Town. He was subsequently ruled out of the Champions Trophy at home and is currently in London for rehabilitation and recovery, a privilege Ali feels to have not received when he was injured a few years ago. Accusing the PCB of giving special treatment to Ayub, Ali said on the 'Ultra Edge' podcast [as quoted by NDTV]: He added: Ayub debuted for Pakistan in 2023 and has established himself as one of their all-format players. The 22-year-old has played 44 matches across formats, scoring over 1,300 runs with three centuries and five half-centuries. Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan has confirmed that ace batter Babar Azam will open the batting in the absence of Saim Ayub in the 2025 Champions Trophy. With the injury to Ayub, Pakistan were forced to open with Babar alongside Fakhar Zaman in the home tri-series (involving South Africa and New Zealand) ahead of the mega event. However, Babar struggled, scoring only 62 runs in three innings at an average of under 21. Talking about Babar opening the batting on the eve of the Champions Trophy opener, Rizwan said [as quoted by India Today]: Pakistan will take on New Zealand in the 2025 Champions Trophy opener in Karachi today (February 19). ""Saim Ayub is injured. He is the player of your team. Wasn't I a member of the team in 2020? If another player gets injured, won't he be a member of the team? Does he play for India?"" ""You're giving VVIP Treatment to Saim Ayub. If someone gets injured in the future, would you give him the same treatment? No, you won't. So, what have you done here? May God give him health and fitness, and may he win a lot of matches for Pakistan. But every rise has a fall. If Saim Ayub gets injured again, will they treat him the same? No, they won't."" ""Its not that we dont have options, we do have. But if you look at the conditions, Babar is the right man to open. We are not sure about reports of Babar not opening the batting. We want genuine openers, but given the needs of the team, we thought that Babar should open as he is a technically strong batter. He is our opener."""
"“Five spinners, I personally feel, is a bit too much” - Former wicketkeeper slams India’s selection for 2025 Champions Trophy",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-five-spinners-i-personally-feel-bit-much-former-wicketkeeper-slams-india-s-selection-2025-champions-trophy,"Veteran wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik questioned the Indian team management's decision to include five spinners in their squad for the Champions Trophy 2025. The initial provisional squad had Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Washington Sundar as the spinners. However, Varun Chakravarthy's late inclusion at the expense of Yashasvi Jaiswal, expanded the list to five members. If the recently held ODI series against England is any indication, Team India wishes to proceed with their three-spinner strategy. While Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja are genuine starters due to their all-round ability, there is a race for the frontline spinner spot. Kuldeep Yadav is coming after a lengthy injury break, and looked to build rhythm in the England ODI series. Washington Sundar is the sole right-arm off-spin in the team, and could be handy in turning the ball away from left-handed batters, if needed. Varun Chakravarthy, on the other hand, was named right after making his ODI debut, and his mystery spin comes across as an X-Factor. Karthik, however, feels that four spinners would have sufficed in providing variety and depth, while five options borders overkill. All five spinners availed game-time in the ODI series against England, with Axar Patel playing all three games alongwith the additional role as the No.5 batter on the side. Recently, former India spinner R Ashwin had also criticised the team management for including five spinners in the squad for the Champions Trophy 2025. Another major selection debate involved the inclusion of Harshit Rana over Mohammed Siraj. Highlighting Siraj's lack of impact with the old ball, Rohit Sharma and the selectors decided to not include him. Newcomer Harshit Rana was initially earmarked for the ODI series against England, but made it to the Champions Trophy as well as Bumrah was deemed unfit to participate. Rana played all three matches against England, picking up six wickets at an average of 24.33 and an economy of 6.95. ""Five spinners, I personally feel, is a bit too much. They could have done with 4, I felt. And thats where I do think it shows a little bit of, not confusion, which is probably a strong word, but not being very sure of what exactly to do because they announced a squad and then they added another spinner for an opener,"" Karthik told Cricbuzz (via Hindustan Times). Look, if you had to go with experience, then yes, Siraj could have been the ideal choice, but I thought Harshit bowled very well against England. What I feel is the Indian camp is very impressed with Harshit Rana. I think Harshit Rana was the debate, but I feel Team India backs him right now more than Siraj,"" Karthik said."
"""They are not a team filled with superstars but they make a superstar team"" - Aakash Chopra on New Zealand's strengths ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-they-team-filled-superstars-make-superstar-team-aakash-chopra-new-zealand-s-strengths-ahead-2025-champions-trophy,"Former India player Aakash Chopra has picked New Zealand's ability to gel together as a unit as their biggest strength ahead of the 2025 Champions Trophy. He pointed out that all their players know their roles and perform to the best of their abilities. New Zealand will face Pakistan in the 2025 Champions Trophy opener in Karachi on Wednesday, February 19. They will subsequently play Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on February 24 and India in Dubai on March 2 in their other two Group A games. In a video shared on his YouTube channel 'Aakash Chopra,' the former India opener chose New Zealand's ability to work as a team as their biggest plus point ahead of the ICC event. Chopra added that the Kiwis prioritize the team's benefit over personal achievements. New Zealand were the runners-up in the 2019 ODI World Cup and reached the semi-finals in the 2023 edition. However, they failed to reach the semi-finals of the 2017 Champions Trophy, losing to England and Bangladesh in the group phase, with their clash against Australia not yielding a result. In the same video, Aakash Chopra chose the presence of the plethora of all-rounders in New Zealand's squad as another of their strengths heading into the 2025 Champions Trophy. The cricketer-turned-commentator added that the Kiwis' recent form and familiarity with the conditions in Pakistan should also hold them in good stead. New Zealand won a tri-series in Pakistan ahead of the 2025 Champions Trophy. They beat the Men in Green and South Africa in the league games before beating the hosts again in the final. ""New Zealand's biggest strength is that they know how to combine the five fingers to make a fist. They are not a team filled with superstars but they make a superstar team. From top to bottom, everyone's role is defined, and they play their role to perfection. Everyone will do their role properly and then they take their team home,"" he said (1:40). ""They believe in processes and planning, and that is why, they don't choke. They actually come together and do better because processes are more important than the individuals. Everyone's role is more important than personal glory. This team is cut from a different cloth,"" he observed. ""They are a team full of all-rounders. You will see three or four keepers in their side. You see off-spinners and left-arm spinners. Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Glenn Phillips, Daryl Mitchell and Michael Bracewell, all of them bat and bowl. Whoever is left out, they keep. Who has so many all-rounders?"" he said (2:50). ""The way they won the tri-nation series recently and defeated India in India before that, they are not dropping matches. They beat us 3-0 in Tests and beat Pakistan and South Africa in all three games. They lifted the trophy without dropping a single game. So their current form is good and they have excellent knowledge of these conditions,"" Chopra observed."
Star player unhappy with Gautam Gambhir after being dropped from India’s playing 11 for 2025 Champions Trophy: Reports,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-star-player-unhappy-gautam-gambhir-dropped-india-s-playing-11-2025-champions-trophy-reports,"Team India's off-field woes continue in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy as delicate dressing room unrest surfaces. A wicket-keeper batter is reportedly frustrated with head coach Gautam Gambhir for not being considered in the playing XI for the upcoming event. The Men in Blue only had three ODIs against England recently to experiment and work out a combination that ticks all the boxes. In the series whitewash, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Varun Chakrvarathy, and Harshit Rana all made their respective ODI debuts, while the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Washington Sundar, and Kuldeep Yadav were rotated accordingly. Rishabh Pant was the sole player in the squad to not avail any game time. There were talks of the wicket-keeper batter potentially featuring in the last match as part of the rotation, but KL Rahul made the cut yet again. Following the series win, Gambhir had asserted that KL Rahul is Team India's first-choice wicket-keeper in ODIs, and also that Pant has no choice but to wait for his opportunity. According to a report by Times Now, Pant is not pleased with just warming the bench, and playing second-fiddle in the 50-over format. Rishabh Pant brings in a valuable trait with his left-handed batting, but the management have backed Axar Patel to don the particular role in the middle order to maintain the combination. The move to promote the all-rounder up the order has also led to KL Rahul coming in at No.6. The wicket-keeper batter has largely struggled while operating towards the end of the innings, and scored only 52 runs in the England series. However, he did score a positive 29-ball 40 in the series finale. The flamboyant wicket-keeper batter has had a start-stop ODI career, and looked at his brightest just before the fateful accident in late 2022. He scored his maiden ODI ton in the 2022 tour of England, and looked set for bigger things. However, he had to miss the 2023 ODI season, and the subsequent World Cup due to injury. He returned to the format in the away series against Sri Lanka in August 2024, scoring six runs off nine deliveries in his sole appearance. The wicket-keeper was struck on his knee off a Hardik Pandya delivery ahead of India's Champions Trophy 2025 opener against Bangladesh, but the blow is not expected to hamper his availability for the tournament. At the moment, KL is a No.1 wicketkeeper for us, and hes delivered for us. And see, when youve got two wicketkeepers in this squad, you cant play both the wicketkeepers with the kind of quality weve got. Hopefully, whenever he (Pant) gets that opportunity, he should be ready for it. Thats all I can say at the moment. Right now, KL is the one whos going to start, Gambhir said after the third ODI in Ahmedabad (via Indian Express). ""Sources have exclusively confirmed to Times Now that a current India wicketkeeper is unhappy with head coach Gautam Gambhir. The player is currently not the first choice in the playing XI for ODIs. He feels that there is an external reason behind him losing his spot in the 50-over format,"" the report read."
Former England captain picks semifinalists for 2025 Champions Trophy; predicts India vs Pakistan final,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-former-england-captain-picks-semifinalists-2025-champions-trophy-predicts-india-vs-pakistan-final,"Former England captain Nasser Hussain has predicted an India-Pakistan final in the 2025 Champions Trophy, starting February 19. The two teams played in the final of the previous edition of the Champions Trophy in 2017, with Pakistan getting the better of their arch-rivals by 180 runs. India and Pakistan will play each other in their Group A clash in Dubai on Sunday, February 23. Meanwhile, Hussain picked Australia and England as the semifinalists from Group B, also featuring South Africa and Afghanistan. He predicted India to defeat England in the first semifinal and Pakistan to take down Australia in the second semifinal. Coming to the final, Hussain backed India to beat Pakistan and win their third Champions Trophy title. Hussain wrote in his column for the Daily Mail: He added: Pakistan will take on New Zealand in the tournament opener today (February 19) in Karachi. Meanwhile, Team India will play their first game of the Champions Trophy against Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday, February 20. Nasser Hussain also predicted Afghanistan to be the dark horse in the tournament and picked Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman to be the player to watch out for in the 2025 Champions Trophy. Afghanistan qualified for their first-ever semifinal in an ICC event in the 2024 T20 World Cup. Meanwhile, Fakhar was the Player of the Match in the 2017 Champions Trophy final against India, scoring 114 off 106 deliveries. In the same column, Hussain wrote: He concluded: Afghanistan are part of Group B, along with Australia, England, and South Africa. They play their tournament opener against the Proteas in Karachi on Friday, February 21. ""I had Australia down to win the Champions Trophy six weeks ago, but since the loss of their three key seamers and two all-rounders, I now see India as firm favorites.Yes, they are without Jasprit Bumrah, who is the best cricketer on the planet at the moment. Mohammed Shami has also just come back from injury and looked a yard short of a gallop in the games against England."" ""But India have so much depth with the bat, with the likes of Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, and so many spin options, who are all all-rounders as well. Another advantage India have is that they will play all their matches in Dubai, so they dont have to travel and will get very used to the conditions."" ""While I actually havent got them going through to the semi-final, there is a lot of jeopardy in this tournament. If the conditions are there for Afghanistan, they will absolutely be a threat. Under the coaching of Jonathan Trott, Afghanistan have made incredible progress."" ""Aside from the obvious stars like Sharma, Gill, Buttler, Travis Head and Kane Williamson, someone Id like to have a good tournament is Pakistan opening batter Fakhar Zaman. He has been in and out of the side for a variety of reasons, but he is Pakistans dynamic hitter at the top of the order and can get them off to a flyer. If Zaman has a good tournament, then his team have got a great chance."""
"“When it involves the head, you want to be absolutely certain” - NZ batter’s massive fitness update on Rachin Ravindra for 2025 Champions Trophy",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-when-involves-head-want-absolutely-certain-nz-batter-s-massive-fitness-update-rachin-ravindra-2025-champions-trophy,"New Zealand wicketkeeper-batter Tom Latham has issued a crucial update regarding Rachin Ravindra's injury ahead of their Champions Trophy 2025 opener against Pakistan at Karachi's National Stadium on Wednesday (February 19). The all-rounder is in a race against time after missing most of the preceding tri-series (involving Pakistan and South Africa) due to a face injury. Ravindra was struck on the face by the ball while attempting a catch during the first match of the tri-series against Pakistan at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on February 8. The player was profusely bleeding after the blow and had to leave the field with the physios immediately. He missed the remainder of the tri-series and has not been definitively cleared for the upcoming contest. New Zealand head coach Gary Stead recently said Ravindra was progressing well after dealing with persistent headaches for a few days. Tom Latham mentioned that Ravindra will train with the rest of the team on the eve of the contest, and given the sensitive nature of the injury, the management will take a call accordingly when they are entirely sure of his recovery. In Ravindra's absence, New Zealand have stuck with the opening combination of Will Young and Devon Conway. New Zealand were handed a late blow as pacer Lockie Ferguson was ruled out of the 2025 Champions Trophy due to a foot injury. All-rounder Kyle Jamieson has replaced him but has yet to join the team, as he was involved with Canterbury in domestic cricket until yesterday, February 18. The Blackcaps already ruled out Ben Sears due to injury, while a late call is expected regarding Rachin Ravindra's involvement. As a result, the team are yet to lock down the playing XI for the Group A encounter. New Zealand head into the Champions Trophy with some serious form under their belt. They have won five out of their last six ODIs, including the tri-series in Pakistan and the home series against Sri Lanka. ""He will train tonight, so we'll get a better indication of how he's progressing. His recovery is going well, but we just need to make sure. ""It was a pretty nasty injury. When it involves the head, you want to be absolutely certain everything is fine. He's following the necessary protocols, and we'll wait and see,"" Latham said during the pre-match press conference (via India Today). ""No, we haven't finalised our XI yet. We have training now and will decide afterward. As you mentioned, Kyle Jamieson is arriving tomorrow, so unfortunately, he won't be available for our first game but will be ready for the rest of the tournament,"" Latham said in the same press conference."
"""I see only 1 weakness"" - Aakash Chopra on New Zealand's concern ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy clash vs Pakistan",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-i-see-1-weakness-aakash-chopra-new-zealand-s-concern-ahead-2025-champions-trophy-clash-vs-pakistan,"Former India player Aakash Chopra has picked New Zealand's death bowling as their only significant weakness ahead of their 2025 Champions Trophy clash against Pakistan. He pointed out that the Kiwis will miss Lockie Ferguson due to injury, with Tim Southee and Trent Boult also no longer part of their setup. Mitchell Santner and company will square off against the Men in Green in the 2025 Champions Trophy opener in Karachi on Wednesday, February 19. Matt Henry, Jacob Duffy, Will O'Rourke, Kyle Jamieson and Nathan Smith are the frontline seamers in their 15-member squad. In a video shared on his YouTube channel 'Aakash Chopra', the former India opener opined death bowling is potentially New Zealand's only weakness heading into the ICC event. Chopra added that the Black Caps might come unstuck in that phase of the game. Aakash Chopra noted that New Zealand do not have a leg-spinner in their squad. While observing that it can be considered a weakness, he added that isn't a shortcoming that could drown them. In the same video, Aakash Chopra noted that the 2025 Champions Trophy presents New Zealand with an opportunity to win the title in Mitchell Santner's first ICC event as captain. The cricketer-turned-commentator added that the 2023 World Cup semi-finalists could go all the way this time around. Aakash Chopra noted that New Zealand would meet India with two wins if they beat Pakistan and Bangladesh before heading to Dubai for their final Group A game. He added that the Men in Blue would be under pressure in that clash in such a scenario unless they too beat Bangladesh and Pakistan in their first two group games. ""I see only one weakness, which is actually a weakness, and that's their death bowling. Lockie Ferguson is not there now. Kyle Jamieson is in. Tim Southee and Trent Boult are also not there now, not that they were the greatest death bowlers, but they were there,"" he said (5:15). ""In the bowling now, they have Matt Henry, Jacob Duffy, Jamieson and Will O'Rourke. Death bowling is a little bit of a concern. They might get stuck a little there. There is a possibility,"" Chopra observed. ""They are playing their first ICC event under Mitchell Santner's captaincy. So, of course, there is an opportunity. They have already lifted the tri-nation series trophy. So they know what to do,"" he said (6:05). ""Opportunities are immense. This is the team that can actually go and lift the trophy. They reach close to the trophy in men's ICC events but are unable to lift the trophy many times. So this is what they can do now. If they beat Pakistan, they will qualify as well because they have to play Bangladesh after that,"" Chopra observed."
“I can’t understand what their issue is” - Former Pakistan cricketer blasts India ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-i-can-t-understand-issue-is-former-pakistan-cricketer-blasts-india-ahead-2025-champions-trophy,"Former Pakistan cricketer Mushtaq Mohammad has expressed his agitation at the BCCI ahead of Champions Trophy 2025 over not sending the Indian team to the neighboring nation. Mohammad observed how Pakistan go to India without raising any objection but the latter doesn't quite follow the same. Although Pakistan were awarded the rights to host the eight-team tournament in 2021, it wasn't until December 2024 that the schedule was announced due to the deadlock over where would India play their games. The PCB finally agreed to a hybrid model for the Champions Trophy, according to which the Men in Blue will play their matches in Dubai despite Pakistan being the designated host. Speaking to Geo News, Mohammad stated that their country has proved time and again that they are excellent hosts and provide great hospitality to any team who visit it. The sub-continent nation hasn't hosted an ICC event since the 1996 World Cup. International cricket had also been stopped in the country from 2009-2019 due to the attack on the Sri Lankan team outside Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore during their 2009 tour of Pakistan. Although teams like Australia and England have played in Pakistan after the resumption of international cricket, the BCCI and Indian government have repeatedly cited security concerns. The 81-year-old suggested that Pakistanis deserve the privilege of watching the Indian team play in their nation and added: The arch-rivals had locked horns in the 2017 Champions Trophy final in which Pakistan emerged victorious. They will face each other in the 2025 edition on February 23. ""Indian cricket team should have come to Pakistan, the entire cricketing world wanted them to come to Pakistan. I cant understand what their issue is. We have proven in the past that we are excellent hosts who always look after the visiting teams in the best possible manner. Pakistan always go to India without raising any objections but when its time for Indians to visit Pakistan they always make lame excuses to not come to Pakistan."" ""Their attitude is not good for the game of cricket especially for the cricket fans in Pakistan as they will be deprived of watching Indian players whore without doubt among the best in the world in action in front of them. Indian team has a huge fan following in Pakistan and for them, it is very disheartening."""
“Keep underestimating us” - Mohammad Rizwan takes subtle dig at former cricketers ahead of 2025 Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-keep-underestimating-us-mohammad-rizwan-takes-subtle-dig-former-cricketers-ahead-2025-champions-trophy,"Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan has urged experts and fans to continue underestimating his side so that they could perform well in the 2025 Champions Trophy. The eight-team tournament, often called the 'Mini World Cup,' begins today (February 19), with Pakistan taking on New Zealand in Karachi. The Men in Green have struggled in recent ICC events, suffering pre-semifinal exits in the 2023 ODI World Cup and the 2024 T20 World Cup. Pakistan are also coming off a disappointing home tri-series with New Zealand and South Africa, losing twice to the Black Caps in the build-up to the mega event. Talking about his side in the press conference on the eve of the tournament opener, Rizwan said [as quoted by India Today]: He added: Pakistan are the defending champions of the Champions Trophy, having won the 2017 edition despite being the lowest-ranked side in the tournament. Yet, several pundits have written them off from even qualifying for the semifinal, with India and New Zealand pitted as the favorites from Group A, which also has Bangladesh. Mohammad Rizwan hit back at critics of Pakistan cricket by highlighting the side's relative consistency despite the lack of home games over the past decade and a half. The 2025 Champions Trophy will be the first ICC event hosted by Pakistan since the 1996 ODI World Cup. He concluded: Despite the setback in the recent home tri-series, Pakistan's ODI form has been impressive over the past few months. They won three consecutive bilateral ODI series in Australia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa before the tri-series. ""If that's how we win, then keep underestimating us. Hopefully, we win. Look, we have a few concerns. As a player, I would say we need to improve our awareness a bit. We need to enhance our professionalism. There is no doubt that Pakistan has achieved great things. We have produced exceptional players."" ""Even now, young cricketers approach us to learn, and players from other countries do the same. I believe that if we work hard, execute our plans, and play smart cricket on the day, the Almighty will reward us."" ""We always say - if you look at our team and our processes now, we endured 10 years without international teams visiting Pakistan, yet we still delivered strong performances for the nation. So, no one should doubt our talent, our ability, or our facilities,"" Rizwan said in the same press conference. ""Yes, on certain days we might underperform or fail to play to our full potential, allowing other teams to capitalize. But we are working hard to rectify that and ensure the results favor Pakistan."""
"Picking an all-time India-Australia Champions Trophy playing 11 ft. Ravindra Jadeja, Adam Gilchrist",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/picking-all-time-india-australia-champions-trophy-playing-11-ft-ravindra-jadeja-adam-gilchrist,"The ninth edition of the ICC Champions Trophy is all set to commence on February 19 (Wednesday) with the opening match slated to be played between hosts Pakistan and New Zealand. The eight-team tournament makes a return after an eight-year hiatus. Pakistan won the previous edition in 2017, beating arch-rivals India by 180 runs in the final. The Champions Trophy will see the top eight teams from the 2023 World Cup fight it out in a round-robin and knockout stage with the final slated to be played on March 9. India and Australia are two of the most successful teams in the competition, with two titles to their name. The Men in Blue won the tournament jointly with Sri Lanka in 2002 before winning their next by beating England in the 2013 final. Meanwhile, the Aussies won back-to-back tournaments in 2006 and 2009. Injuries have marred both these top two sides. Australia will be missing at least five of their premier players, and India will have to deal with the absence of their pace spearhead and the biggest match-winner in modern times, Jasprit Bumrah. While India and Australia won't meet in the league stage, they could play each other in the semi-final or final. With the tournament scheduled to begin in a few hours, we have compiled a combined all-time India-Australia Champions Trophy XI. Here is the combined India-Australia playing XI: Shikhar Dhawan just played two Champions Trophy but due to his stellar run in the competition, he is currently the third-highest run-getter in the tournament with 701 runs in just 10 innings with three centuries and as many fifties at an average of 77.88. The southpaw will open the innings in this combined XI. Dhawan made a century in his first two outings against South Africa and West Indies and there was no looking back from there on. He won the Golden Bat Award in both 2013 and 2017. He will be partnered by former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly who is the fifth-highest run-getter in the Champions Trophy history. Ganguly played 13 Champions Trophy matches from 1998-2004, scoring 665 runs in 11 innings at an average of 73.88. He also scored three fifties and three centuries in the process. One of the greatest Indian captains, Ganguly scored 141 in the semi-final against South Africa in 2000 to set up a final date with New Zealand. The two-time World Cup-winning captain Ricky Ponting will lead this combined XI and will bat at number three. He also led the Aussies to Champions Trophy wins in 2006 and 2009. Ponting appeared in the inaugural edition of the tournament in 1998 and went on to play his final match in 2009. He scored 593 runs in 18 innings at an average of 39.53 with a century and four fifties. Pontings teammate Damien Martyn also has a brilliant record in the Champions Trophy. One of the most aesthetically pleasing batters to the eyes, Martyn scored 492 runs in 11 Champions Trophy innings at an average of 61.50 with five fifties to his name. Touted as a Test batter during the initial stages of his career, Rahul Dravid went on to become a prolific run scorer in ODIs as well and played some vital knocks for India in the Champions Trophy. A makeshift wicket-keeper as well, Dravid scored 627 runs in 15 innings at an average of 48.23 with six fifties. One of the leading match winners for Australia in the Champions Trophy, Shane Watson also finds a place in the playing XI. He scored centuries in the final of the 2006 and 2009 Champions Trophy to orchestrate Australias triumphant campaign. In 15 matches, Watson scored 453 runs at an average of 41.18 with two centuries and as many fifties. He also bagged 17 wickets to go with his solid batting numbers. The swashbuckling southpaw Adam Gilchrist batted the majority of his career at the top of the order. Given the condition of the match and how much they are chasing, Gilchrist can also be moved up the order. However, for the moment, he has to bat a bit lower down the order. He will also don the keeping gloves. The swashbuckling southpaw scored 382 runs in 13 innings at an average of 31.83 with two fifties. Indian spin all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja had a brilliant start to his Champions Trophy campaign in 2013, bagging a five-wicket haul against West Indies in just his second hand. In 10 matches, Jadeja has picked 16 wickets at an average of 25.18. He has also chipped in with some crucial knocks, none better than the one he played against England in the 2013 final. One of the fastest bowlers of the modern generation, Brett Lee, finds himself a place in this playing XI. His intimidating factor forced batters to commit mistakes. A tearaway fast bowler in his own right, Brett Lee made his Champions Trophy debut in 2000 and last participated in the tournament in 2009. Lee is the fourth-highest wicket taker in the tournament with 22 wickets in 15 innings at an average of 26.86 and best figures of 3/38. His bowling partner for a majority of his career, Glenn McGrath will spearhead the attack in his company and will look to take early wickets. The pacer who could keep hitting the same area throughout the day is the fifth most successful bowler in the Champions Trophy history with 21 wickets in 12 innings at an average of 19.61. He bowled some stunning spells in the competition, having made his CT debut in 2000. Former Indian spearhead Zaheer Khan will complete the team. Left-arm seamers are always in high demand and when it's someone with the skill sets of Zaheer Khan, you can't leave him out. The left-arm pacer hogged the limelight with his stunning performance in the 2000 Champions Trophy. He played just two editions but bagged 15 wickets in nine matches at an average of 24.53."
"Pakistan vs New Zealand, 2025 Champions Trophy: National Stadium, Karachi pitch history and ODI records",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/pakistan-vs-new-zealand-2025-champions-trophy-national-stadium-karachi-pitch-history-odi-records,"Karachi's National Stadium will host the opening match of the 2025 Champions Trophy on Wednesday, February 19. Defending champions Pakistan will take on Mitchell Santner-led New Zealand in the first game of the tournament. Pakistan and New Zealand recently battled twice on Pakistan soil, with New Zealand winning both games. The Blackcaps won the group-stage match of the tri-series (including South Africa) against Pakistan and beat them in the final as well. New Zealand will start as the favorites to win the upcoming match. Before the mega event begins, here's a glance at the pitch history and ODI records of National Stadium. Karachi has hosted 56 ODI matches so far, with teams batting first winning 26 times. Teams batting first and teams batting second have an almost equal win percentage, showing that toss does not play a huge role in ODIs on this ground. Here are some other crucial stats to know from the previous ODIs played in Karachi: Matches played: 56 Won by teams batting first: 26 Won by teams batting second: 28 Tied: 0 No result: 2 Highest individual score: 181 - Sir Viv Richards (WI) vs Sri Lanka, 1987 Best bowling figures: 6/13 - Ajantha Mendis (SL) vs India, 2008 Highest team total: 374/4 - India vs Hong Kong, 2008 Lowest team total: 115 - Bangladesh vs Pakistan, 2008 Highest successful run-chase: 355/4 - Pakistan vs South Africa, 2025 Average first innings score: 246. The pitch in Karachi is generally good for batting. In the recently played tri-series between Pakistan, South Africa, and New Zealand, the hosts chased down a 353-run target against South Africa on this ground. Anything around 300 should be a good score in the first innings. Pacers should dominate initially, but batters and spinners should have a larger say in the game as the contest progresses. New Zealand defeated Pakistan by five wickets in the last ODI hosted by this venue. The match was played on February 14, 2025, when the Blackcaps comfortably chased down a 243-run target against the Men in Green. Daryl Mitchell and Tom Latham smashed a half-century each for the Blackcaps. Fast bowler Will O'Rourke took four wickets while spinner Mitchell Santner bowled a tidy spell of 2/20 in 10 overs. Brief scores: New Zealand 243/5 (Daryl Mitchell 57, Naseem Shah 2/43) beat Pakistan 242 (Mohammad Rizwan 46, Will O'Rourke 4/33) by 5 wickets."

It will be a massive occasion for Pakistan as the Asian country is hosting an ICC event after a huge gap of 29 years. Coming back to the opening contest, Pakistan and New Zealand clashed in a small tri-series ahead of the Champions Trophy, with South Africa being the third team. Despite Mohammad Rizwan and co. having the home advantage, the Kiwis beat them twice, including in the final in Karachi. New Zealand would undoubtedly be buoyed by the impressive performance. Pakistan would be disappointed with their performance in the tri-series, where they lost two out of three matches. There has also been plenty of criticism around their team selection for the Champions Trophy from a number of ex-cricketers. Having said that, it is no secret in world cricket that one can never write off Pakistan. Pakistan and New Zealand have clashed 118 times in one-day cricket, with the Asian side having a 61-53 lead in the head-to-head battle. One match has ended in a tie, while three have produced no result. Here's a look at the head-to-head record of the two teams in ODIs. Matches Played: 118 Matches won by Pakistan: 61 Matches won by New Zealand: 53 Matches tied: 1 Matches with No Result: 3 Pakistan have never beaten the Kiwis in a Champions Trophy clash.

"""I've no fear, but that thing, it scares me""- Top 10 funny memes ahead of ICC Champions Trophy 2025",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-i-ve-fear-thing-scares-me-top-10-funny-memes-ahead-icc-champions-trophy-2025,"Fans online have posted several memes ahead of the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which will be hosted by Pakistan. However, Team India will play their matches in Dubai as they decided against traveling to the neighboring country. The tournament will commence on Wednesday (February 19) with a clash between Pakistan and New Zealand in Karachi. Several star players are missing the Champions Trophy due to injury issues and personal reasons. World Champions Australia will be without their captain, Pat Cummins, who failed to recover in time from an ankle injury he sustained during the BGT 2024-25 Test series against India. His bowling partners, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, will also miss the eight-nation tournament. A back injury forced all-rounder Mitchell Marsh to be on the sidelines. Another Australian all-rounder, Marcus Stoinis, retired from ODI cricket after initially being named in the squad. South Africa will be without their express pacers Anrich Nortje and Gerald Coetzee at the Champions Trophy due to fitness issues. Team India bowling spearhead and ICC Cricketer of the Year 2024, Jasprit Bumrah, has been ruled out of the Champions Trophy after failing to recover from a back injury he suffered during the Sydney Test in January. England and Pakistan will also miss the services of exciting youngsters, Jacob Bethell and Saim Ayub, respectively. Fans took note of all the developments and shared memes on social media platforms. One of the memes read: Here are some other memes: Former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar recently analyzed the impact of Jasprit Bumrah's absence for Team India during the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy. He felt that it was not a surprise as the team management made contingency plans by giving rookie pacer Harshit Rana some game time. However, he felt that Bumrah's ability to bail out India from difficult situations would be hard to replicate for other bowlers. Speaking to ESPNCricinfo, Manjrekar said: He added: ""I've no fear, but that thing, it scares me."" ""Bumrah's absence is not an event. It's not like suddenly India have realized that they will be without Bumrah. Somewhere, they were all aware that it's going to be touch and go and India made preparations accordingly. Harshit Rana's emergence and Arshdeep, who had a great T20 series; Mohammed Shami slowly getting fit."" ""When Bumrah comes in, the crunch moments in the big games are taken care of. He just makes sure that India are back in the game in the crunch moments. That ability very few bowlers have. And that is what India will miss. India will not suddenly look like a weak side, but these big moments in matches where Bumrah would get India back in a winning position, the other bowlers will find it very hard to replicate."""

5 landmarks Virat Kohli can reach in 2025 Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/5-landmarks-virat-kohli-can-reach-2025-champions-trophy,"Virat Kohli is set to feature for the fourth time in the Champions Trophy in the upcoming edition. He is the highest run-getter in the history of the tournament among the players in the 2025 edition. While he has largely been out of form in the recent past, he scored a crucial half-century in the final ODI against England and looked in good touch. India will bank on the senior pro and Virat Kohli will have a vital role to play in the Champions Trophy. Kohli has scored 529 runs from 13 matches in the history of the tournament and boasts an impressive average of 88.16 with a best score of an unbeaten 96 in the semi-final against Bangladesh in the 2017 edition. The star Indian batter will have the opportunity to reach several landmarks during the 2025 Champions Trophy. As mentioned above, Virat Kohli has scored 529 runs from 13 matches in the history of the Champions Trophy. Former West Indies superstar Chris Gayle has the most runs in the tournament with 791 runs from 17 matches. Therefore, Kohli needs 263 runs in the upcoming edition to overtake Gayle and become the highest run-scorer in the history of the tournament. India will play three group stage matches and two more games if they make it to the semi-final and final. Virat Kohli has scored five half-centuries from thirteen matches in the Champions Trophy so far. Former Indian cricketer and legend Rahul Dravid tops the charts for the most half-centuries in the history of the tournament with six fifties to his name. If Kohli scores two fifties in this edition, he can become the batter with the most half-centuries in the history of the tournament, leaving behind Rahul Dravid. Virat Kohli, who made his debut in 2008, has played 297 matches for India in the format and has amassed 13963 runs from 285 innings at an average of 57.93 with 50 hundreds and 73 half-centuries. If Kohli scores 37 runs in the 2025 Champions Trophy, he will become the fastest batter to reach the 14,000-run mark in ODIs. Former cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakkara are the only other batters with over 14,000 runs in the format. Tendulkar took 350 innings to get to the milestone while Sangakkara took 378 innings. Virat Kohli has been a prolific run-getter for India in international cricket. Overall, the right-hander has played 545 matches across all formats and has piled on 27,381 runs in his career so far. The 36-year-old needs just 103 runs to overtake Ricky Ponting and become the third highest run-getter in international cricket. Ponting played 560 matches and amassed 27,483 runs. Sachin Tendulkar (34,357) and Kumar Sangakkara (28,016) are first and second on the list, respectively. Virat Kohli has won four ICC trophies in his career so far. He first won the U-19 World Cup in 2008, before winning the ODI World Cup in 2011, the Champions Trophy in 2013, and the T20 World Cup in 2024. Australian legend Ricky Ponting has won five ICC titles as a player, including three ODI World Cups (1999, 2003, 2007) and two Champions Trophy editions (2006 and 2009). If India win the 2025 Champions Trophy, Kohli will become the player with the joint most trophies in ICC events."
"""My prayers are with them"" - When a former India cricketer dedicated his Champions Trophy award to flood victims",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-my-prayers-them-when-former-india-cricketer-shikhar-dhawan-dedicated-champions-trophy-award-flood-victims,"Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan has an excellent record in the ICC Champions Trophy. In 10 innings across two editions, he scored 701 runs at an average of 77.88 and a strike rate of 101.59, with three centuries and three half-centuries. The former India batter was the leading run-getter in both the 2013 and the 2017 editions. The southpaw totaled 363 runs in 2013 and 338 runs in 2017. Dhawan won the 'Golden Bat' award for being the top run-getter in the 2013 edition held in England, which India won by beating the hosts in a close final in Birmingham. While Dhawan won a lot of fans for his sensational batting performance in the Champions Trophy, he also won hearts with his gesture of dedicating his award to Uttarakhand flood victims. As per official figures, the 2013 Uttarakhand floods resulted in over 6,000 deaths. The floods were considered one of India's worst natural disasters. The 2025 edition of the Champions Trophy will be played in Pakistan and Dubai from February 19 to March 9. A total of eight teams are taking part in the ICC event, with India being clubbed in Group A with Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. Group B features Australia, South Africa, England and Afghanistan. While there are a number of strong teams in both groups, Dhawan reckons that the Men in Blue have a great chance of clinching the trophy yet again: He told ICC: Dhawan had a wonderful record in the one-day format for India. In 167 matches, the left-handed batter scored 6,793 runs at an average of 44.11 and a strike rate of 91.35, with 17 hundreds and 39 half-centuries. ""I would like to dedicate my performance to the people who have lost their lives back home due to the flood. My prayers are with them,"" Dhawan said after winning the Golden Bat award in 2013. ""I cant look past India. I am quite confident. They have a solid team and played very well against England in their recent ODI series. ""There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic for India. They have a very balanced side, especially with the bat, with a nice blend of experience and youth,"" the 39-year-old went on to add."
“We know how good he’s been in T20 cricket” - Ricky Ponting picks Jasprit Bumrah’s replacement in Indian playing XI for Champions Trophy 2025,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-we-know-good-he-s-t20-cricket-ricky-ponting-picks-jasprit-bumrah-s-replacement-indian-playing-xi-champions-trophy-2025,"Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has shared his views on Jasprit Bumrah's replacement in Team India's playing eleven for Champions Trophy 2025. Ponting strongly feels Arshdeep Singh should replace Bumrah, given how the left-arm seamer has a similar skill set to Bumrah. The ace bowler will miss the eight-team event due to a back injury he sustained during the five-Test tour of Australia. Arshdeep, who has played only nine ODIs so far, is one of the three pacers in the squad alongside Mohammed Shami and Harshit Rana. Speaking on the latest episode of the ICC Review, the Tasmanian said Harshit Rana has plenty of talent but his death-bowling is not in the same breath as Arshdeep. He elaborated: In nine ODIs, Arshdeep has claimed 14 scalps at an average of 23 and played only in the final game of the three-game series against England recently at home. His List A record is promising, picking up 55 scalps in 33 matches, averaging 24.30. The 26-year-old has been outstanding for India in T20Is, taking 99 scalps in 63 games, and is their leading wicket-taker in the format. Ponting feels if any team has the talent pool to replace a player of Bumrah's caliber, it's India as the 50-year-old added: Team India will open their campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 and will play all their matches in Dubai. ""I would go with the left-armer and I'd go with Arshdeep (to replace Bumrah). We know how good he's been in T20 cricket and if you think about the skill set, he probably provides a similar skill set to what Bumrah does with new ball and death overs and that's what India will miss."" ""That's taking nothing away from Harshit Rana because I think he has got a lot of talent and we know what he can do with the new ball, but I don't think his death skills are as good as what Arshdeep Singhs are."" ""I think we all felt that they were going to be one of the main dangers anyway. Even with Bumrah not being there, I mean, yes, it's very hard to replace someone like that. But if any team can do it with the amount of talent that the Indians have got, it might be them."
Rohit Sharma vs Shikhar Dhawan - comparing their stats in the Champions Trophy,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/rohit-sharma-vs-shikhar-dhawan-comparing-stats-champions-trophy,"Team India captain Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan formed a terrific opening combination for the Men in Blue in ODIs for nearly a decade. They joined forces during the 2013 Champions Trophy in England, and over the next few years, they featured in a number of defining opening stands in the one-day format. As a batting pair, Rohit and Dhawan opened the batting together for India in ODIs in 115 innings. They combined to score 5,148 runs at an average of 45.55, with 18 century stands and 15 half-century partnerships, which included a best of 210. The Rohit-Dhawan duo is among only four opening pairs to have notched up 5,000-plus partnership runs. The list is led by Sourav Ganguly-Sachin Tendulkar (6,609). While Dhawan has retired from all forms of cricket, Rohit will be leading the Men in Blue in the 2025 Champions Trophy, which begins on Wednesday, February 19. On that note, we compare the numbers of the two batting stars in the ICC event. Both Rohit and Dhawan have played 10 matches for India in the Champions Trophy. In 10 innings, the former has scored 481 runs at an average of 53.44 and a strike rate of 82.50. As for Dhawan, in 10 innings, he notched up 701 runs at an average of 77.88 and a strike rate of 101.59. Rohit played five innings in the 2013 edition, scoring 177 runs at an average of 35.40 and a strike rate of 75.96. In the 2017 Champions Trophy, he contributed 304 runs in five innings at an average of 76 and a strike rate of 86.85. Looking at Dhawan's numbers, in five innings in 2013, he scored 363 runs, averaging 90.75 at a strike rate of 101.39. The southpaw also batted on five occasions during the 2017 Champions Trophy in England, notching up 338 runs at an average of 67.60 and a strike rate of 101.80. Rohit has registered five 50-plus scores in the Champions Trophy, which includes one century and four half-centuries. His best of 123* came off 129 balls against Bangladesh in Birmingham in the 2017 Champions Trophy semifinal. The Hitman also scored 91 off 119 against Pakistan in Birmingham (2017), 78 off 79 against Sri Lanka at The Oval (2017) and 65 off 81 against South Africa in Cardiff (2013). Dhawan registered six 50-plus scores in the Champions Trophy. His stats include three centuries and three fifties. The left-hander's best of 125 came off 128 balls against Sri Lanka at The Oval in 2017. He also hit 114 off 94 against South Africa in Cardiff (2013) and 102* off 107 against the West Indies at The Oval (2013). Of his three fifties, one each came against South Africa, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. India reached the finals of both the 2013 and the 2017 Champions Trophy. They beat England by five runs in a contest reduced to 20-overs per side in 2013 in Birmingham. The Men in Blue were thumped by arch-rivals Pakistan by 180 runs in the 2017 summit clash at The Oval. In two innings in Champions Trophy finals, Rohit managed nine runs, averaging 4.50 at a poor strike rate of 52.94. The Hitman was dismissed for nine off 14 balls in the 2013 summit clash against England, bowled through the gate by Stuart Broad. In the 2017 final, he was trapped lbw for a three-ball duck by Pakistan left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir. Dhawan has a better record than Rohit in Champions Trophy finals, but not an impressive one by any stretch of the imagination. He totaled 52 runs, averaging 26 at a strike rate of 113.04. In the 2013 final against England, he was dismissed for 31 off 24 balls, caught at extra cover off Ravi Bopara's bowling. In the 2017 final, he was out for 21 off 22, caught behind off Amir's bowling."

He seemed mighty impressed by the former king's devotion to the motherland. The second Chhatrapati of the Maratha empire, Chhatrapati Sambhaji's life has become a big talking point lately. A Bollywood film based on his life was released on February 14. The Vicky Kaushal starrer has taken the Indian box office by storm, reportedly collecting over 140 core in four days. Hailing Chhatrapati Sambhaji's devotion, Gambhir wrote on the microblogging platform X: Gautam Gambhir is in Dubai with the Indian team for the 2025 Champions Trophy. The ICC event makes a return after a gap of eight years. The competition will feature the top eight teams of ODI cricket. Defending champions Pakistan will host the tournament. However, India refused to send their team to the neighboring country due to security concerns. The Men in Blue will play all their matches at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Gautam Gambhir recently shared a photo on Instagram of him where he could be seen enjoying some Indian desserts. Sharing the picture, the cricketer-turned-coach captioned the post: Gambhir's former Team India teammate Yuvraj Singh reacted to the caption with a hilarious comment, asking the erstwhile opening batter to smile more. He wrote: Responding to Singh's comment, Gambhir wrote: It is worth mentioning that the 2025 Champions Trophy will be Gambhir's first ICC event as Team India's head coach. The Rohit Sharma-led side will take on Bangladesh in their opening encounter on Thursday, February 20. ""   Devotion to Motherland!"" ""Life is short, make it sweet!""

"""I love watching him bowl"" - Michael Atherton picks Indian bowler as leading wicket-taker of Champions Trophy 2025",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-i-love-watching-bowl-michael-atherton-picks-indian-bowler-leading-wicket-taker-champions-trophy-2025,"Former England skipper Michael Atherton heaped praise on Indian left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav. He has predicted him to be the leading wicket-taker of the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025. Atherton observed that Kuldeep possesses plenty of varieties and bowls with an attacking instinct that makes him quite a threat in Dubai. Kuldeep, who averages 26.22 in 108 ODIs, is one of the five specialist spinners picked in their Champions Trophy squad. The 30-year-old played only in two matches in the three-game ODI series against England and managed as many wickets. Hence, it's uncertain whether he will start the tournament. Speaking on Sky Sports, Atherton said he will go with Heinrich Klaasen as the leading run-getter of the event. While the former opener claimed he had previously shortlisted Adil Rashid as the leading wicket-taker, he feels England will struggle to reach the top four. He said: England, clubbed in Group B alongside Australia, South Africa, and Afghanistan, succumbed to a 3-0 series sweep against India in ODIs before the Champions Trophy. Yet another ex-England captain Naseer Hussain believes Rohit Sharma and Co. are the firm favourites to win the Champions Trophy 2025. Hussain also named Shubman Gill and Arshdeep Singh as the highest run-scorer and highest wicket-taker, respectively. He said: Led by Rohit, the Men in Blue will open their campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai. Their big clash against against Pakistan is on February 23 and will face New Zealand on March 2. The Asian Giants were the runners-up in the 2017 edition and lifted the title in 2013. ""I will go for South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen as leading run-scorer as he is in hot form. Perhaps you should go for an opener or someone in the top three but he is a top-notch short-form player and should get plenty of opportunities. ""For wicket-taker I was going to say England leg-spinner Adil Rashid, who really is a master of his craft now, but as I have my doubts about them making the semi-finals, I will go for India's Kuldeep Yadav. I love watching him bowl. He is a really attacking spinner with plenty of variety and is playing in a part of the world that will help spin more."" ""I am saying India will win it and therefore play the most games, so I will pick Arshdeep Singh as leading wicket-taker. He has only played nine ODIs so far but is India's highest T20 international wicket-taker and can bowl at the start and end of an innings. For run-scorer, I will say Gill. Rohit loves the Champions Trophy and ICC events in general but Gill is in the form of his life in this format."""
"""Suffered enough for a long time"" - Mohammad Rizwan urges Pakistan to enjoy Champions Trophy 2025 as nation hosts an ICC event after 29 years",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-suffered-enough-long-time-mohammad-rizwan-urges-pakistan-enjoy-champions-trophy-2025-nation-hosts-icc-event-29-years,"Pakistan skipper Mohammad Rizwan has called for the players to enjoy the Champions Trophy 2025 as the nation gears up to host its first ICC event since the 1996 World Cup. The 32-year-old reckons the sub-continent country has suffered enough and it's time to enjoy the carnival. Due to security concerns, Pakistan hasn't been awarded an ICC tournament since 1996. Even after seven teams have agreed to play in the Asian country, the BCCI refused to send the Indian men's side, who will play all their games in Dubai. At a presser on Wednesday ahead of the tournament opener against New Zealand, Rizwan expressed his pride in Pakistan capturing the 2009 T20 World Cup and the 2017 Champions Trophy title. As quoted by Geo Sports, he stated: International cricket stopped in Pakistan after a handful of gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan team during their tour in 2009. It only resumed in 2019 but high-profile teams like England, West Indies, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand have played in Pakistan across formats. With fast bowler Haris Rauf sustaining an injury during the preceding tri-series, Rizwan said the right-arm speedster has returned to full fitness and is confident about him bowling in full tilt. The keeper-batter said, as quoted by CricketPakistan: Pakistan will be keen to defeat New Zealand after losing twice to them in the ODI tri-series. ""A global event has come to Pakistan after 29 years so I think the whole nation should enjoy this historic occasion. Pakistan has suffered enough and for a long time, but we have also won during this phase like the 2017 Champions Trophy and the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup."" ""Haris Rauf is bowling in rhythm and is completely fit now. He himself is feeling much better and we are all optimistic about his contributions in the Champions Trophy. He has been working hard on his fitness and we can see the positive results. We are hopeful that Haris will play a crucial role in the tournament. He has proven himself as a valuable asset to the team, and we are excited to see him back at full fitness."""
Pat Cummins picks Indian pacer among bowlers he enjoys watching and admires,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-pat-cummins-picks-indian-pacer-among-bowlers-enjoys-watching-admires,"Australian pacer Pat Cummins picked Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah among bowlers he enjoys watching and admires. Along with Bumrah, he named South African pacer Kagiso Rabada as well. In a conversation with PTI (via NDTV), Pat Cummins stated that Bumrah and Rabada have been consistent wicket-takers and that he has had wonderful contests against them in his career. In the same conversation, Cummins, who also leads Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and has a lucrative contract with the franchise, emphasized on the fact that his love for Test cricket has always made it an easy decision for him to prioritize the longer format. Pat Cummins also brought out his book titled 'Tested: The remarkable power of resolve' published by Harper Collins. Talking to PTI, Cummins revealed that he interviewed 11 achievers and leaders from around the globe for his new book. Cummins has played 67 Tests for Australia, having picked up 294 wickets at an average of 22.43. He has played 90 ODIs and has grabbed 143 wickets at an average of 28.78 along with 66 wickets from 57 T20Is. He also captained Australia to victory in the 2023 ODI World Cup, 2023 World Test Championship final, and the 2024-25 Border Gavaskar Trophy. However, he is injured and will miss the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan. ""Those two guys (Bumrah and Rabada) are bowlers I enjoy watching and admire. They have been taking wickets consistently for many years and we've had some wonderful contests,"" he said. ""I love Test cricket so much so its always been an easy decision to keep that as my number one priority. Especially in Australia, we are lucky to have Test cricket so well-supported,"" the 31-year-old reflected. ""I started with a list of people I knew and admired and whose life stories exemplified resilience, leadership and the power of resolve. Then, over a number of months, I engaged in conversations with eleven extraordinary individuals, including Indian entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala, former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, former Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee."" he said."
Virat Kohli gives autographs to fans and interacts with them ahead of ICC Champions Trophy 2025 [Watch],https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-virat-kohli-gives-autographs-fans-interacts-ahead-icc-champions-trophy-2025-watch,"Team India stalwart Virat Kohli extended a warm gesture towards his ardent fans in Dubai by giving an autograph and interacting with them. Kohli is currently with the Indian squad in Dubai, preparing for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which commences on February 19. India's campaign in the tournament will begin the following day with a clash against Bangladesh. The Men in Blue will then face Pakistan and New Zealand in the group stage on February 23 and March 2, respectively. The players are currently undergoing training in Dubai to prepare themselves for the Champions Trophy. While returning to the team bus recently following a practice session, Virat Kohli took some time out and met his fans waiting nearby, giving them autographs. You can watch the video below: Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra recently opined that the upcoming Champions Trophy might potentially be the last ICC tournament for senior players like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ravindra Jadeja. Analyzing the matter in a video on his YouTube channel, Chopra said: He added: ""We always say never say never, that you might see Rohit playing the next World Cup and Virat and Jadeja could be seen for sure as he (Jadeja) is super fit. We don't talk about Jaddu's fitness that much. He is as fit as Kohli and might be fitter than him, but we talk about Kohli remaining fit till 2027. The question won't be whether these people can play till then."" ""The question will be whether Indian cricket can survive without them or not. The question should always be how long Indian cricket needs a particular player and whether a better option is available at that time. I feel there is a strong possibility this could be the last ICC event for Rohit, Jadeja and even for Virat Kohli."""
3 reasons why India must be wary of New Zealand in Champions Trophy 2025,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/3-reasons-india-must-wary-new-zealand-champions-trophy-2025,"The Champions Trophy 2025 is set to begin on Wednesday, February 19. With the previous edition taking place in 2017, the tournament is returning after a long hiatus. India and New Zealand are placed in the same group this time around. The two sides will face each other at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, February 23. In the previous edition, India topped their group and made it to the final of the Champions Trophy, eventually losing to Pakistan. On the other hand, New Zealand finished at the bottom of their group, failing to win a single match from their three games. However, both India and New Zealand are among the favorites to win the tournament in the upcoming edition. As India gears up for the Champions Trophy 2025, here are three reasons why they must be vary of New Zealand. New Zealand participated in the recently concluded tri-nation series in Pakistan which also involved South Africa. They first beat Pakistan by a convincing margin of 78 runs. In their next match, they chased down 305 runs against South Africa and defeated them comfortably by six wickets as well. The Kiwis once again faced Pakistan in the final of the tri-nation series. They continued their brilliant run by bowling the hosts out for just 242 and chasing it down easily in just 45.2 overs with five wickets remaining to win the final. They won all three games they played and were unbeaten as well, coming into the Champions Trophy 2025 with great form. New Zealand's batting line-up has gained considerable form ahead of the Champions Trophy. In the tri-nation series, several Kiwi batters hit form and will be confident heading into the ICC event. Kane Williamson ended as their highest run-getter with 225 runs from three innings at an average of 112.50 with an unbeaten 133 and a half-century as well. The likes of Glenn Phillips (154 runs from three games), Daryl Mitchell (148 runs from three games) and Devon Conway (145 runs from two games) were also among the runs. With all these batters in form, India's inexperienced pace attack, comprising Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana, could definitely face the heat if the Kiwi batters carry their impressive form. New Zealand have always troubled India more often than not when it comes to their meetings in knockout matches in any ICC event. Back in 2000, the Kiwis beat India in the final of the Champions Trophy. They knocked India out of the 2019 World Cup as well with their win in the semi-final. The 2021 World Test Championship final also saw New Zealand triumph over India. The 2023 World Cup semi-final has been the only exception so far as India beat the Kiwis. Given New Zealand's record against India in ICC knockout matches, it could certainly give them an edge should India lose to either Bangladesh or Pakistan. This could then turn their final group-stage clash against New Zealand into a virtual knockout contest."
"""The lies do hurt"" - Pakistan star opens up on agony of dealing with rumors and speculation ahead of Champions Trophy 2025",https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-the-lies-hurt-pakistan-star-opens-agony-dealing-rumors-speculation-ahead-champions-trophy-2025,"Pakistan pace bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi expressed disappointment over untrue reports and misinterpreted facts being reported about him by journalists ahead of the Champions Trophy 2025. The speedster was in the news on a recurring basis last year for his sacking as skipper, tussle with coaches, and omission from the red-ball side. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) only gave Shaheen Afridi one series as captain before Babar Azam was reinstated again under Moshin Naqvi's regime as chairman. There were intense reports of a potential feud with Babar Azam as well as the cricket board after Afridi had posted several posts on his social media following his removal as captain. Journalists also reported Shaheen Afridi's friction with the coaching staff, particularly Mohammed Yousuf, during the white-ball tour of England ahead of the 2024 T20 World Cup. He was said to be let off with a warning by the management, with another set of reports claiming that he had to apologize to the entire team. 2024 also saw Afridi being dropped from the Test side midway through the home series against England. However, his absence from the Test series against South Africa, away from home, came as a shock, considering the pace-friendly conditions. Reports soon emerged that Afridi recused himself from the tour, preferring to play white-ball cricket during the lead-up to the Champions Trophy 2025. However, Afridi confirmed that he will always be available to play Test cricket, and lambasted the relentless and baseless rumors and reports. Another persisting set of opinions that Afridi has to deal with regularly is regarding his pace. The general consensus has been that the left-arm seamer has lost his potency after injuring his knee twice in 2022. However, he defended his current bowling speed, suggesting that the pace has not dipped in a way that makes him toothless with the new ball. Afridi added: The pacer will come into the Champions Trophy on the back of some solid form. He played a huge role in Pakistan's ODI series whitewash in South Africa, picked up four wickets in five matches in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) and ended as the joint-highest wicket-taker in the tri-series. Afridi will be part of the Pakistan team that will play an ICC event on home soil for the first time since 1996. The Men in Green have had decent support behind them wherever they play, be it Sydney or Manchester, but have never experienced the same privilege on home soil until now. Afridi hopes for a unanimous atmosphere like at the Narendra Modi Stadium, where a crowd of 100,000 were firmly behind the Indian team during the 2023 ODI World Cup clash against Pakistan. Afridi looked back at the time when he dismissed opening batter Shubman Gill for 16 runs in the third over of the run chase, recalling: Pakistan will play the Champions Trophy 2025 opener against New Zealand at the National Stadium in Karachi on Wednesday, February 19. ""I will always be available for Test cricket. What frustrates me is when people say things about me that are just not true. In Pakistan, unfortunately, a lot of the time fans and journalists do not tell or report the truth. That is really dispiriting to see,"" Afridi said in an interview with ESPN Cricinfo. ""If people say something critical about me but it is based in fact, it doesn't hurt me. But the lies do hurt, especially when journalists - whose job it is to tell the truth - do the opposite of it."" ""People take a lot of interest in my speeds. But aside from the 2021 T20 World Cup, if you look at my bowling, I bowl between 135-137kph in the first over. But people notice it now and think my pace is down. ""But I've never felt my pace is down in a way that it is stopping me getting wickets. The body is a bit like a machine and can break down. Sometimes you get fatigued and you can't show it because you have to do what the team requires of you."" ""We always play these events away, and I've always noticed how the home team gets such huge support, which gives you a boost. When we played the World Cup [2023] in India with over 100,000 people watching at the venue, and I got [Shubman] Gill out early on, I felt you could have heard a fly buzzing, such was the silence."" ""The crowd can create an atmosphere for that game, unlike what happens for any other game. And that is a different kind of pressure. We're excited to experience that ourselves this time,"" he added."
