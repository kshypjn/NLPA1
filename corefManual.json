Eight teams will compete in two groups of four, playing 12 group-stage matches, followed by the semifinals and final. Sri Lankan pacer Farveez Maharoof holds the record for the best bowling figures in Champions Trophy history. His remarkable spell of 6\/14 against West Indies in 2006 at the Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai, skittled it out for just 80. Australias Josh Hazlewood is the only other bowler to take a six-wicket haul in the tournament, achieving the feat against New Zealand in the 2017 edition. The best bowling figures by an Indian in the Champions Trophy belong to Ravindra Jadeja, who claimed 5\/36 against West Indies in 2013."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-02-23T13:19:29.896043Z","updated_at":"2025-02-23T13:44:56.799100Z","inner_id":14,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
